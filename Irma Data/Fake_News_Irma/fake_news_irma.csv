						Did a Man Die from Shooting a Gun at Hurricane Florence?","In September 2018, a 33-year-old man in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, died after the bullet he shot at Hurricane Florence rebounded and hit him in the head.","False
					
						
							About this rating","In September 2018, the arrival of Hurricane Florence on the eastern coast of the United States (especially North and South Carolina) brought its fair share of online misinformation and hoaxes, including one false story inspired by a prank reused from the 2017 hurricane season.
“Myrtle Beach Man Who Shot at Hurricane Florence Dies After Bullet Ricochets,” read the headline of a 13 September 2018 article on the CGCNews.com website:

A 33-year old man from Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, has been confirmed as one of the first fatalities of Hurricane Florence after he ignored warnings and fired a weapon into the storm. According to a source who responded to the scene the 33-year old is believed to have fired a large calibre weapon earlier this afternoon; however, the bullet ricocheted and ended up entering the man’s head. It’s believed he died instantly.
The incident comes after a Facebook event called “Shooting guns at Hurricane Florence to scare it away” went viral with over 22,000 South Carolina natives marking their interest in attending on Facebook. While the majority of them appear to have heeded the warnings not to actually shoot at the hurricane, the 33-year old Florence man who remains to be formally named was not among them.
This story was fabricated. We could find no corroboration for the notion that someone died after shooting a round at Hurricane Florence, either in South Carolina or anywhere else, although we checked with law enforcement agencies and news sources from the states in the path of the storm.
Police in Myrtle Beach told the McLatchey news agency that they had received no reports of any such incident.
The Facebook event mentioned by CGC News is real and had 34,000 would-be “attendants” as of 14 September 2018. The creator of that virtual event added the following disclaimer: “Note: do not actually discharge firearms into the air. You could kill someone and you cannot frighten a hurricane. I cant believe I actually have to write this.”
“Shooting guns at Hurricane Florence to scare it away” was very similar to a September 2017 Facebook event called “Shoot at Hurricane Irma,” a virtual assembly later characterized by its creator as a joke that spiraled out of control."

You see, a hurricane is God’s way of saying you are meant to be homeless. So in a sense, your homelessness is a gift from heaven.
The photograph was likely from a 7 May 2015 meeting between Carson and community leaders in Baltimore. But there is no record of Carson making that statement about hurricane victims.
In a September 2017 interview, Carson said that families who receive federal housing assistance would get help in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey, which caused significant damage in parts of Texas:
We will make sure that they’re all taken care of. In many cases where things have been destroyed, we’ll have to go to some transitional housing first. But yes, we’ll be taking care of all of them.
	
		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
Carson has also promised that HUD would be “a rapid, responsible and compassionate agency” in its response.
A HUD spokesperson told us that around 500,000 homeowners affected by Harvey and Hurricane Irma in Florida currently have mortgages insured by the Federal Housing Administration. Those homeowners are eligible for a 90-day “foreclosure moratorium.”
The caption used in the image of Carson could be a play on a remark he actually did make during a May 2017 interview:
I think poverty to a large extent is also a state of mind. You take somebody that has the right mindset, you can take everything from them and put them on the street, and I guarantee in a little while they’ll be right back up there. And you take somebody with the wrong mindset, you can give them everything in the world, they’ll work their way right back down to the bottom.
When asked in September 2015 how he would deal with Hurricane Joaquin, Carson — then a Republican presidential candidate — told reporters, “I don’t know.”"

						Can Hurricane Victims Delay Their Mortgage Payments?","Homeowners affected by hurricanes are allowed, under certain circumstances, to delay their mortgage payments.","True
					
						
							About this rating","After hurricanes Harvey and Irma tore through Mexico, the Caribbean, and the southern United States in September 2017, American government agencies and private mortgage companies offered assistance to homeowners needing to delay their mortgage payments.
A spokesperson for the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development, Brian Sullivan, told us on 15 September 2017 that approximately 280,000 Florida homeowners using Federal Housing Administration-insured loans live in counties affected by Hurricane Irma, and that about 220,000 homeowners in parts of Texas damaged by Hurricane Harvey (which made landfall earlier in the month) are currently using FHA loans.
The department has some information on its web site:
If you can’t pay your mortgage because of the disaster, your lender may be able to help you. If you are at risk of losing your home because of the disaster, your lender may stop or delay initiation of foreclosure for 90 days. Lenders may also waive late fees for borrowers who may become delinquent on their loans as a result of the disaster.
FHA borrowers are automatically eligible for a 90-day “foreclosure moratorium”(preventing the start of foreclosure proceedings) in the event of a natural disaster if they or their families live in counties that have been declared a federal disaster area by the government. They are also eligible if:

 They are related to someone who was injured or killed, or reported as missing because of the incident.
 The disaster “directly or substantially affected” their ability to pay their mortgage.

	
		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
HUD also advises:
FHA’s Foreclosure Moratorium only applies to borrowers in default. If you are current, you should continue to make your mortgage payment whenever possible. If, however, you are unable to pay your loan as a result of the disaster, your lender may waive any late fees normally charged and let you know about other options.
If their lender is not able to help them, the agency urges borrowers to contact HUD directly for assistance.
Two private mortgage companies, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, also offer loan deferment programs for customers affected by natural disasters. Borrowers with loans through each company are potentially eligible to pause their mortgage payments for up to 12 months while waiving late fees or risking having a delinquency on their loan reported to credit bureaus.
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau also operates a phone line connecting people unsure whether to pursue forbearance (as the practice of suspending a mortgage payment is known) with counselors from HUD. College students using federally-funded loans who are affected by natural disasters like the two hurricanes are potentially eligible for loan forbearance lasting up to 90 days."

						Did the Governor of the United States’ Virgin Islands Sign an Order Allowing the Seizure of Weapons During Hurricane Irma?","In September 2017, U.S. Virgin Islands Governor Kenneth Mapp signed an executive order empowering the National Guard to seize weapons and other private property.","True
					
						
							About this rating","On 5 September 2017, reports appeared that Kenneth Mapp, governor of the U.S. Virgin Islands, had authorized the national guard in the territory to seize weapons and ammunition as part of an effort to maintain public order during and after Hurricane Irma:
U.S. Virgin Islands Gov. Kenneth Mapp signed an emergency order allowing the seizure of private guns, ammunition, explosives and property the National Guard may need to respond to Hurricane Irma.
Mapp signed the order Monday in preparation for Hurricane Irma. The order allows the Adjutant General of the Virgin Islands to seize private property they believe necessary to protect the islands, subject to approval by the territory’s Justice Department.
The Daily Caller obtained what appears to be an authentic copy of the order, which sets the National Guard on active duty in the territory and orders them to keep public order and public safety “in the face of imminent danger or potential disaster from Hurricane/Tropical Storm Irma.” It also authorizes and direct Brigadier General Deborah Howell, the U.S. Virgin Islands Adjutant General, to seize weapons, ammunition and other property that may be needed for the National Guard’s emergency mission during Irma.
The Adjutant General is authorized and directed to seize arms, ammunition, explosives, incendiary material and any other property that may be required by the military forces for the performance of this emergency mission, in accordance with the Rules of Force promulgated by the Virgin Islands National Guard and approved by the Virgin Islands Department of Justice. 
The order was signed on 4 September 2017, and went into effect the next day.  
	
		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
Despite the fairly clear-cut language used in the executive order, Governor Kenneth Mapp firmly denied that he had authorized the seizure of firearms or other property from citizens in an interview with Tucker Carlson on Fox News on 6 September 2017: 
I did not order or authorize the Adjutant General of the Virgin Islands National Guard to seize any weapons from any citizens, and I do not have the power — by Virgin Islands law or by the Constitution of the United States — to seize weapons from citizens via the military.
Mapp then said the order does empower the Adjutant General “to seize arms, ammunition, explosives, incendiary material”, but claimed this meant the National Guard could purchase such items from a store, if they lacked the firearms they needed to keep public order:
[The Adjutant General] has the authorization to spend government resources and acquire. We don’t seize property without due compensation to the property owner, after the appropriate assessment.
In the interview with Tucker Carlson, Mapp attempted to draw a distinction between “seizing weapons and other property that may be required by military forces”, and “seizing weapons and other property from citizens”, which he said was not mentioned in the executive order.
It is true that the order doesn’t contain the word “citizens” or “civilians” but it is unclear how the order could be interpreted as not being applicable to property owned by civilians, unless he intended the National Guard to be authorized to seize only property owned by incorporated companies or trusts. No such stipulations or distinctions are made in the executive order.
Mapp told Carlson the order did not allow the Adjutant General to “go into people’s homes” and acquire property, but to acquire property “as the government acquires property on the open market”: in other words, to buy it. He added that the executive order empowered the Adjutant General to purchase weapons and ammunition from retail outlets without having to “go through the procurement processes of the government.”
Again, this is not set out in the order itself. There is also a certain redefinition of language at work here, given that the Governor is claiming that the meaning of “to seize” in the order is “to purchase without going through the procurement processes of the government.”		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		


It is possible that Kenneth Mapp intended the order to authorize the National Guard only to purchase private property, but it is therefore entirely unclear why the order would empower the Adjutant General to “seize” weapons and ammunition, rather than to “purchase” them. It’s also possible that, upon reflection, it is now his considered position that the National Guard should be authorized only to purchase property, rather than seize it.
Either way, the language in Kenneth Mapp’s executive order is clear — it empowers the Adjutant General of the U.S. Virgin Islands National Guard to “seize” firearms, ammunition and other private property. It can reasonably be assumed that such confiscation would extend to the property of civilians, especially since there is nothing in the order to contradict this natural assumption, or to stipulate that only property owned by incorporated entities or trusts may be seized."

						Did a 2005 Movie Feature Hurricanes Named Harvey and Irma?",The 2005 movie Category 7: The End of the World predicted the arrival of hurricanes named Harvey and Irma.,"False
					
						
							About this rating","In September 2017, rumors emerged on social media that a 2005 movie predicted current events by featuring two hurricanes named Harvey and Irma — and that this somehow proved that the hurricanes were both human-engineered.
A typical viral message read as follows:
11 years and 9 months ago a movie came out called “Category 7 End of the World” and there were only two episodes called “Harvey” and “Irma”! Read that over a few times until it sinks in! These are NOT “storms”, but predictive program attacks on the American people that they told “U.S.” about in the Hollywood black magic ritual of telling their victims exactly how you intend to take their lives.
The second hurricane called IRMA in the movie struck the United States on 9/11, and guess when this storm is suppose to hit “U.S.”? This is way too much of a “coincidence” for even the casual observer to ignore. 
Category 7: End of the World was a two-part made-for-TV movie broadcast by CBS in November 2005. It’s an apocalyptic thriller directed by Dick Lowry and starring Shannon Doherty about a series of extreme weather events that cause destruction around the world.
In the movie, a hurricane named Eduardo strikes Florida and Washington, D.C., while an unnamed Category 6 storm hits New York. Eventually the two combine, causing the movie’s eponymous Category 7 storm, which threatens a global catastrophe. 
	
		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
None of the storms or hurricanes in the movie was named Harvey or Irma. Furthermore, Category 7: End of the World was broadcast in November 2005, which was 11 years and 10 months (not nine months) before Hurricane Irma’s expected landfall in Florida on 10 September 2017. So the meme’s two key claims were false. 
However, even if these claims were accurate, they would have no sinister meaning. 
Atlantic hurricanes are named from a prescribed list of names that are rotated every six years and published in advance. So we already know the list of potential hurricane names for 2018, 2019, and every year for the foreseeable future, unless they are changed by the World Meteorological Association. 
There was a Hurricane Harvey, for example, in 2011 and a Tropical Storm Harvey in 2005 and 1999. Had the filmmakers named their fictional storms Harvey or Irma, they could easily have chosen them from the same publicly available list.
Even if there had been 11 years and 9 months between the original broadcast of Category 7: End of the World, and Hurricane Irma’s expected landfall, this would be a meaningless coincidence.
To believe otherwise requires believing a vast, unfeasibly complicated conspiracy theory involving the movie’s writers, directors, CBS, and the federal government, who would then have to engineer and manage a tropical storm into a powerful hurricane (something that is impossible) and time its development to perfection so that it makes landfall in the United States on 11 September 2017 exactly.
In reality, Hurricane Irma is expected to hit the continental U.S. on 10 September 2017. 
However, again, even if the post had gotten the dates right, the idea that they contain significance is an example of cherry-picking numerical patterns (which exist everywhere) and contorting them to fit pre-existing beliefs and theories. We have addressed such pattern-seeking previously, in the context of both hurricanes and terrorist attacks.
The “Category 7” meme consists of a ludicrous conspiracy theory based on evidence-free claims about government “geoengineering” and numerology, and ignores the fact that hurricane names are made public years in advance. Furthermore, its two key factual claims – that the hurricanes in the movie were named Harvey and Irma, and that the movie was released 11 years and nine months ago – are false."

Two burglars got more than they bargained for recently after picking the wrong house to break into. Garfield Morgan, 54, and his 36 year old accomplice friend Kim Gorton are both career burglars, having stolen from hundreds of homes in their lives. But it’s unlikely they’ll go back to crime after the nasty episode they experienced in the home of one Florida man…
Harry Harrington is 6’7″ and weighs over 300lbs. It’s pure muscle. He’s a notorious gay s*x predator who has served time in jail for numerous sexual assaults. An aggressive and predatory offender, he’s not the kind of man you want to annoy. But that’s just what Morgan and Gorton did that fateful night.
Harrington, known as ‘The Wolfman‘, easily overpowered the men, tied them up and assaulted them for five full days. Police only intervened after a neighbor heard the men’s cries for help and called them.
There was no truth to this story. The newspaper clipping shown above originated with the Sunday Sport, a British tabloid that publishes a mixture of softcore pornography, gossip, and outlandish stories such as “Donkey Robs Bank,” and “Aliens Turned Our Son Into a Fish Finger.”
In addition to the story’s dubious source, the photographs included with it were also suspect. The image purportedly showing Harry “The Wolfman” Harrington had been circulating online since at least 2009, and one of the mugshots purportedly showing either “Garfield Morgan” or “Kim Gorton” actually depicted a man named Michael Patrick Kelly who was arrested in 2004 for lewd conduct with a minor.
The premise of this rumor was repurposed in September 2017 for a fake CNN news article which claimed that two looters (now named James Tobbes and Michael Smith) were sodomized after breaking into a home during Hurricane Irma."

							About this rating","On 9 September 2017 the web site YourNewsWire.com published an item suggesting that theoretical physicist and CBS News contributor Michio Kaku had said that the recent hurricanes Harvey and Irma were the result of a government research program that shuttered in 2014. 
The article, titled “Top Scientist Tells CBS: HAARP Responsible For Recent Hurricanes,” claims that physicist and professor Michio Kaku had confessed that the High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program, an Alaska-based program created to analyze the ionosphere, which has been the subject of numerous conspiracy theories, had created the two deadly hurricanes:
World renowned physicist Dr. Michio Kaku made a shocking confession on live TV when he admitted that HAARP is responsible for the recent spate of hurricanes.
In an interview aired by CBS, Dr. Kaku admitted that recent ‘man-made’ hurricanes have been the result of a government weather modification program in which the skies were sprayed with nano particles and storms then “activated” through the use of “lasers”.
In the interview (below), Michio Kaku discusses the history of weather modification, before the CBS crew stop him in his tracks.
The High-Frequency Active Auroral Research Program (HAARP) was created in the early 1990’s as part of an ionospheric research program jointly funded by the U.S. Air Force, the U.S. Navy, the University of Alaska Fairbanks, and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA).
The claim quickly spread to several conspiracy blogs, YouTube channels, and Facebook pages in early September 2017.
Kaku never said that HAARP was responsible for hurricanes. YouTube videos espousing the conspiracy theory splice together misinformation about HAARP with an interview Kaku did with CBS News in 2013 in which he talked about the possibility of governments one day being able to cause rainfall using lasers and other means. 
	
		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
The description of the official video of the CBS interview read:
Scientists and researchers may one day be able to manipulate rain and lightning using lasers. “CBS This Morning” contributor Michio Kaku, a physics professor at City College of New York, talks to Charlie Rose and Norah O’Donnell about the potential future of weather.
 
In the video, Kaku also discusses the possibility that governments had manipulated weather in the past to cause or prevent rainstorms, and he calls the evidence “inconclusive” several times. He said of current efforts to manipulate the weather that there was “nothing conclusive … [but scientists are] bringing in the laws of physics” and “actually using trillion watt lasers” in such experiments. Kaku mentioned hurricanes at the end of a list of future theoretical weather modification applications:
… in the laboratory, sure enough they [now] precipitate rain out of water vapor … [but] the bad news is if it’s a clear blue sky, it’s not gonna do anything at all … outdoor events, and agriculture, and flooding, and even hurricanes all can be subject to weather modification.
We reached out to Kaku, who told us “The story is 100% false.”
Kaku also appeared on CBS in August 2017 to discuss Hurricane Harvey and the science behind hurricanes. He did not at any point say that HAARP had caused hurricanes."

						Raw Sewage Still Poses Threat in Aftermath of Hurricane Irma",null,null,"One Everglades City, Florida resident has died and another contracted a leg infection requiring amputation after wading in floodwaters contaminated by sewage and seaborne bacteria left behind by Hurricane Irma, which battered the small fishing community with 140-mile-an-hour winds and inundated it with an 8-to-10-foot storm surge on 10 September 2017.
According to local press reports, 72-year-old Lee Marteeny died at Physicians Regional Hospital after treatment for respiratory failure and internal bleeding. Florida’s District 20 Medical Examiner established the cause of death as “Vibrio bacteremia due to water contamination complicating liver disease, ethanolism and severe cellulitis and lymphedema of lower extremities.”
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Vibrio bacteria (for example, V. vulnificus and V. parahaemolyticus) occur naturally in seawater and can be acquired either via consumption of undercooked seafood or the direct exposure of a wound or abrasion via immersion in contaminated water. In 2005, the CDC reported that a number of patients were diagnosed with Vibrio-related illnesses traceable to storm surge floodwaters after Hurricane Katrina. 
Sewage system overflows were reported all over Collier County in the days immediately following the hurricane, and tests conducted by Collier County Pollution Control on 17 September confirmed the presence of extremely high levels (“too numerous to count”) of fecal coliform and E. coli bacteria in the floodwaters that still surround much of Everglades City. Local residents remain under notice to boil all drinking water and many have lined up to receive tetanus shots and precautionary treatment for infections at a temporary medical clinic set up at the Everglades City school. 
Although an inspection of the Everglades City sewage treatment plant a few days after the storm found no substantial damage, a state Department of Environmental Protection official told Naples Daily News, it had not been conclusively determined whether or to what degree the “troubled” sewage plant, which the city was already under court orders to repair or rebuild, contributed to the bacterial contamination of the water.
As one of the Florida communities hardest hit by Hurricane Irma, Everglades City was still without power and running water when Gov. Rick Scott visited to survey the damage on 17 September, noting that the floodwaters were still very high and housing is a “significant issue” for local residents. According to Everglades City Mayor Howie Grimm, in fact, two-thirds of the city’s homes and buildings are now uninhabitable and there are no overnight shelters in the immediate vicinity, meaning that many residents are stuck in housing contaminated with raw sewage and mold.
Grimm says it will take years for the community to recover.
This is a 22 September 2017 update from the Collier County Dept. of Health:
Everglades City is currently under a boil water notice. There are crews working to get power completely restored to Everglades City and surrounding areas. Hurricane Irma hit this area with a significant storm surge, and right now we are focused on the response and recovery phase, which may take some time.
The Florida Department of Health in Collier County (DOH-Collier) has been working with our community partners to aid in response. DOH-Collier staff have been going door-to-door, particularly in Everglades City, for several days beginning Sunday, Sept 17 to provide health education. We also deployed an environmental health team Saturday, Sept. 16 to assess conditions and aid in mitigation. Also on Sunday, we set up a vaccine clinic at a local church in Everglades City that provided TDaP vaccines and we have been there every day since providing vaccine to residents. There is currently a Disaster Medical Assistance Team (DMAT) deployed in Everglades City providing medical services. We’ve also mobilized additional resources to the area including shower facilities, mud boots and additional vaccines."

						During a Hurricane, Should You Store Important Items in Your Dishwasher?",Dishwashers are a reliably safe place to store valuable documents and photographs during hurricanes or flooding.,"False
					
						
							About this rating","On 6 September 2017, as Hurricane Irma swept across the Caribbean and towards southern Florida, a Facebook user posted the advice that a dishwasher is an ideal spot to hide valuables during a hurricane:


The post had racked up over a million shares within a few days, and its advice even wound up on several news roundups of “hurricane hacks“:
Your dishwasher can be a waterproof safe: It’s sealed to keep water in, so it should do just fine keeping it out too. Just make sure all your dishes are taken out before loading up important documents or belongings.
	
		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
The post did not cite any manufacturer, disaster expert, or government agency as vetting the proffered advice, and the reasoning provided (“it’s secured to cabinets”) sounded more like observation than credible information.  And the owner of an appliance repair shop told the Tampa Bay Times in September 2017 that storing valuables in the dishwasher during a flood was a bad idea:

It’s not a good idea to keep valuables in your dishwasher, said Ralph Feldkamp, the owner of Ralph’s Appliance & Air Conditioning Repair in St. Petersburg. Dishwashers don’t keep water out.
Feldkamp said if your home is flooded, so will your dishwasher. He said he sees a lot of flooded dishwashers in Shore Acres. The low-lying neighborhood in northeast St. Petersburg is one of the most flood-prone areas in Tampa Bay.
Besides flooding, extreme wind can tear apart the interior of your residence, including appliances.
“If your dishwasher gets ripped then your valuables are going to be floating around the neighborhood,” he said.
There’s also the possibility that your dishwasher will turn on during the storm, which would not bode well for your valuables.
And in August 2006, New Orleans’ Times-Picayune carried a reader-submitted cautionary tale about storing important items in dishwashers during flooding:
Regarding the tip, “Pack your photographs and important things that you can’t fit into the car in Ziploc bags and put them all in the dishwasher and lock the door, because it’s the only thing that’s waterproof in your house”: That doesn’t work.
I put dishes I wanted to save in my dishwasher. They did not break, but the mud and water in St. Bernard Parish managed to get inside. Photographs stored in a dishwasher would just be little pieces of white paper. Some things I put in Ziploc bags were wet and others were dry. If you put things in Ziploc bags, make sure there are no pinholes in the bag.
The only way to guarantee that pictures will survive is to take them with you. Or scan them into a computer and send copies to several out-of-town friends before you evacuate.
When similar advice appeared on the reddit forum r/LifeProTips, one user responded with another personal anecdote about having lost valuables by trusting them to this approach:


By contrast, we were unable to locate any stories of people successfully protecting their belongings from flood by storing them in a dishwasher."

							About this rating","The Red Cross has long been dogged by the persistent belief that it exacts payment for its services from the victims of disasters. In the wake of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 that notion surfaced again, this time asserting those left homeless and desperate were being charged for coffee, cups of juice, and cookies:
We heard that the red cross was charging people in New Orleans 70 for a cup of juice and a cookie? Assuming we donate money to pay for the aid, could this be true?

I’ve recently heard the Red Cross & maybe the Salvation Army sends bills to the people they help. Say it isn’t so!!

I do know one person, a close friend of mine, who about 20 years ago was displaced due to an apartment building fire. She was provided shelter by the Red Cross but later received a bill from them for their services. That’s the only place I’ve heard the story and it wasn’t a rumor.


The rumor is false: rhe Red Cross does not solicit payment for services rendered from those whom it is called upon to assist during times of emergency. The American Red Cross notes on their web page about disaster preparedness for seniors that “All American Red Cross emergency services are provided free of charge,” and the Southeast Michigan Red Cross web site’s ‘Ask Us‘ page plainly states:

Q: How much does American Red Cross disaster assistance cost?
A: All American Red Cross disaster assistance is free, made possible by the voluntary donations of time and money from the American people. Disaster assistance is given free-of-charge without judgment or a promise of support.
Modern rumors about the service’s turning a profit by taking items it had been supplied with via donations and selling them to the needy date to World War I. George Creel, Chairman of the Committee on Public Information at that time, offered the opinion that vilification tales aimed at the Red Cross bore unmistakable signs of enemy origin, begun in the hopes the negative stories would turn people against the organization. In WWI, and again in WWII, the slander took the form of cautionary tales about sweaters knit by volunteers as gifts for men serving at the front being instead sold to those troops by the Red Cross. One altruistic knitter, it was said, received a letter from a sailor who had come to be in possession of her work, in which the Navy man both thanked her for the garment and asked if she thought it fair he’d had to pay six dollars for it. Also rampant in WWII was scuttlebutt that soldiers serving in the Pacific theater were forced to pay five dollars for cardigans that had Red Cross labels in them. The sweaters the Red Cross collected from volunteers and sent to servicemen were, of course, never sold to GIs; they were always provided for free.
	
		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
Similarly, the Red Cross was said to be selling to servicemen cigarettes that had been donated by major tobacco companies.
The Red Cross blood donor service was also a target of rumor-mongering during WWII. Whispers swept along that blood donations had been accepted from the Japanese, thereby (it was said) making it likely the offspring of those receiving such transfusions would display Japanese characteristics. Similar concerns were raised about blood from African-Americans being added to the pool. Rumor was also used to discourage those inclined to donate blood: stories were spread that those who gave ran the risk of contracting infection or disease from unsterilized instruments.
The Affairs of Dame Rumor, a 1948 book about rumors rampant in America, recorded the following:
The Red Cross rumors illustrate that the enemy rumor mill was designed to sabotage anything the American people might do to help their own war effort. If they were asked to lend aid by contributing their money to this organization, there was a lie that the Red Cross money was terribly mishandled and their books unaudited. If they were asked to become volunteer workers, there was a canard about men in the army saying there is no need for it. If they were being enlisted as consistent blood donors, there was a prohibitive fable about how blood plasma could be kept for only two months and if not used by then was thrown away. If American ladies persisted in knitting sweaters, the falsehood to discourage them was that garments sent to England were being ripped up and the wool sold to the British people. And lies of inefficient practices and waste dogged the efforts of the Red Cross throughout the war.
There is truth to one of the rumors, however. During WWII the American Red Cross did indeed charge American servicemen stationed abroad for coffee, doughnuts, and lodging. However, they did so because the U.S. Army asked them to, not because they were determined to make a profit off homesick dogfaces.
The request was made in a March 1942 letter from Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson to Norman H. Davis, chairman of the American Red Cross. Because American soldiers were fighting as part of the Allied Forces, matters had to be considered on a Force-wide (rather than a solely American) basis. The Red Cross was asked to establish club facilities for U.S. servicemen overseas where Allied troops would be welcome, and because English and Australian soldiers were being charged for the use of such facilities, it was deemed unfair that Americans were to get similar benefits for free (especially in light of the fact that their pay was higher than that of their Allied counterparts). For the good of the alliance, the American Red Cross was persuaded to exact nominal charges from American GIs for off-base food and lodging.
This act resulted in the Red Cross’ coming to be regarded by numerous GIs as having profited off them. Bad feeling exists to this day over the decision to charge American servicemen for these services, with any number of such soldiers and their families carrying long-lasting resentments against the service. Yet while that ire might have been merited, it was misdirected: the culprit was the U.S. Army, not the Red Cross.
General Dwight D. Eisenhower, Chief of Staff, United States Army, addressed the controversy surrounding this issue in a statement to the press on 10 April 1946:
I am surprised to learn that one of the reasons [for Americans not contributing to the American Red Cross] is the complaints being leveled at the organization’s overseas operations by returning servicemen. For the most part these criticisms have grown out of a Red Cross policy of making nominal charges to our forces for food and lodgings in fixed Red Cross installations abroad. These complaints are distressing to me since this particular Red Cross policy was adopted at the request of the Army, so as to insure an equitable distribution among all service personnel of Red Cross resources.I know the Red Cross. I have seen it in action. Overseas it performed with the precision of a well-trained army. It would be grave injustice to the splendid work of the Red Cross if its campaign should be retarded anywhere by mistaken criticisms.		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
Even after World War II, the Red Cross continued to be dogged for years by false tales about their imposing fees on military personnel for basic humanitarian services, such as the following 1952 rumor that claimed the organization had charged a U.S. serviceman interest on money he borrowed from them to attend his mother’s funeral:
A recent rumor to the effect that a serviceman had been loaned money by the Red Cross at 6 per cent interest so he could attend his mother’s funeral was revealed by the local chapter.When the rumor proved to be unfounded, said a local Red Cross official, the serviceman wrote to deny the story: “I have not been asked to pay 6 per cent interest on this loan nor has it ever been suggested by anyone employed by the American Red Cross that I pay interest,” he said. “It was through the joint effort of the Hartford Chapter and the office of the field director that I was granted a leave …”
The story of the interest charging went through a nearby summer resort “like wildfire,” reported the official.
The Red Cross’ version was this: the local serviceman had just been inducted and was beginning his service at an Air Force base. The Red Cross notified him of his mother’s death, and since the serviceman was without enough money for the trip, the chapter advanced him more than $100 which he agreed to pay over a prolonged period — without interest.
The advent of social media breathed new life into rumors the Red Cross was charging disaster victims, which spiked amid separate online controversies involving the organization following Hurricanes Harvey and Irma in August-September 2017:

There is a post going viral stating Red Cross stole goods from churches in Texas in the wake of Harvey and that they are charging 1.25 for water that was donated. 

The Red Cross was stealing from the doorsteps of churches after Harvey devastated Texas. They were protected by order EO 13603, which is an executive order that was signed on March 16 of 2012 by Barack Obama. You can find this information at ObamaWhiteHouse.archives.gov

I am working at a kitchen in midtown Houston that is providing food support to affected areas. We have received several reports that Red Cross sites in the Port Arthur/Beaumont area are, in fact, charging for food. These are reports directly from the field by phone, not internet. We are trying to track down more supporting info for this claim, but it was reported by at least 3 people on site.

In a separate article regarding rumors that the Red Cross was charging  disaster victims after Hurricane Harvey hit in August 2017, we noted:
Just to make sure their policy regarding disaster assistance has not changed since the last time these claims surfaced, we reached out to the Red Cross to ask if they charged for any disaster relief related services in the wake of Harvey. A media representative assured us that all Red Cross disaster assistance is provided free of charge.
The rumors, this time, seem to have spread most rapidly from a 28 August 2017 piece (“Why You Shouldn’t Donate to the Red Cross to Help Hurricane Victims”) by Affinity Magazine, which makes the statement that some disaster victims never received money collected by the organization that was ostensibly there to help them:
When the World Trade Center went down back in 2001, the Red Cross this time raised over a billion dollars in donations. Again, victims of the terrorist attack never saw the money. They opened only a few shelters during the attack and no one came to them. They even handed out coffee and donuts for the rescue workers on site, yet charged them for the food and drinks.

On 31 August 2017, the Red Cross detailed how they would be spending their funds in the wake of Hurricane Harvey, introducing that documentation with the following statement:

The American Red Cross has been truly humbled by the outpouring of public support for those affected by Hurricane Harvey. Working around the clock, the Red Cross is making good use of donations and bringing help where it is needed. Each cot holding a sleeping child, each meal served to a family who is hungry and each blanket a disaster worker wraps around someone wet from the floodwaters is a result of a generous donation. As the storm moves north, flash flood emergencies are in effect throughout the Gulf Coast, and the storm may produce as much as a foot of rain through the end of the week."

							About this rating","Hurricane Irma was the second major hurricane of the 2017 Atlantic hurricane season (after Hurricane Harvey), and the storm brought with it dire predictions that prompted mass evacuations, widespread preparedness activity, and strongly-worded warnings:
Whether it will actually endure a storm of that size and violence isn’t clear. As of Friday morning, Hurricane Irma, one of the strongest hurricanes ever measured in the Atlantic Ocean, was predicted to tear through South Florida and up the center of the state. If forecasts hold, it could be the most ferocious storm seen in the Sunshine State since Hurricane Andrew cut east-to-west across its peninsula a quarter-century ago.
“Irma has me sick to my stomach,” said Eric Blake, a scientist with the National Hurricane Center, on his personal Twitter account on Thursday evening. “This hurricane is as serious as any I have seen. No hype, just the hard facts. Take every lifesaving precaution you can.”
“I have little doubt Irma will go down as one of the most infamous in Atlantic hurricane history,” he added.
As is typically the case with events that can produce widespread damage and destruction, news about Hurricane Irma has been peppered with misinformation, hoaxes, and images of dubious veracity, prompting us to compile some of the most frequently asked reader questions about that potentially devastating weather phenomenon:

Q: Did FEMA push through a law forcing all hotels and motels to accept all pets during hurricane evacuations?
A: No. Disabled persons who utilize service animals are excluded from hotel and motel “pet policies” under the Americans with Disabilities Act, but that policy applies irrespective of weather conditions. More information about this claim is available here.
	
		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
Q: Is the dishwasher a good place to store valuables during a hurricane?
A: The short answer is no, a dishwasher is not an especially safe place in which to secure valuables and keepsakes during a hurricane. The longer answer is available here.
Q: Did airlines begin price-gouging evacuees as Irma approached?
A: Online listings for some airlines initially showed very high prices for flights out of Florida during the approach of Hurricane Irma, but some airlines also later instituted price caps to ensure reasonable and affordable fares for those needing to get out of the state before the storm.
Q: Does a popular video depict Hurricane Irma battering Antigua and Barbuda?
A: No, the storm footage seen in a widely circulated video was actually captured in Uruguay in 2016.
Q: Did Hurricane Irma pick up “sharks” as it developed?
A: A: No. A news chyron seemingly reporting this information was in fact the product of a build-your-own-prank site.		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
Q: Did the governor of the Virgin Islands empower the National Guard to seize weapons and other property in response to Irma?
A: Governor Kenneth Mapp did issue an executive order that does authorize the National Guard to seize firearms and other property if he deems it necessary to keep public order.
Q: Did the 2005 film Category 7: The End of the World feature hurricanes named Harvey and Irma, revealing a conspiracy of weather manipulation?
A: No. The details claimed about that movie in a popular viral rumor were all inaccurate.
Q: Is Hurricane Irma the first “Category 6” storm?
A: No, Despite some putative discussion on the subject, the classification of a Category 6 storm does not exist.
Q: Did right-wing talk radio host Rush Limbaugh call Irma a “liberal hoax,” and then quietly evacuate Florida himself?
No. As the Washington Post reported in an article critical of Limbaugh, the talk radio host accused the news media of exaggerating weather-related dangers but did not suggest Hurricane Irma itself was a hoax.		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
Q: Did 1,000 people die in Barbuda from Hurricane Irma?
A: No. As of 7 September 2017, Irma’s death toll was 10 (after the storm made landfall in Barbuda).

Just heard that Trump set up ID checks at the border between Georgia and Florida to “catch” any illegal immigrants who are trying to flee Irma… and in the process slowing everyone on the road from getting to safety.

Any truth to this? And, if so, why isn’t anyone covering it?
can you verify if Florida Governor Scott said that workers cannot be fired for staying with their family during Hurricane Irma. That an employer cannot fire you if you stay home. I have heard it from several people.

							About this rating","In the wake of the destruction caused by Hurricane Harvey, and in light of the increasing strength of Hurricane Irma, numerous alarmist headlines have suggested that Irma is so strong that it should be identified as a “Category 6” hurricane. Many readers have written in to ask us if Irma is indeed classified as a Category 6. 
Is Irma a Category 6 storm? 
We can say with certainty that Hurricane Irma is not a Category 6 storm and will not become one because that category does not exist. The highest rating on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale is a five, which contains all storms with sustained winds greater than 157 mph.
The idea that Irma is a Category 6 storm seems to have originated with a a blog post that implied that a new category, Category 6, would be created for Irma. While the post does not state this directly, its headline reads “Category 6? If Hurricane Irma Becomes The Strongest Hurricane In History, It Could Wipe Entire Cities Off The Map.” That story, written by end-time enthusiast and Republican candidate for Idaho’s first congressional district Michael Snyder, was first published on his blog “The Economic Collapse” before being aggregated by other clickbait websites.
Are scientists going to create a new Hurricane Wind Scale Category for Irma? 
	
		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
It is true that scientists have brought up the potential need for a new hurricane Category 6. But that discussion began well before the 2017 hurricane season. Snyder juxtaposes quotes about Irma with quotes about the need for a new Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale category in a way that is confusing for readers: 

So how powerful could Irma eventually become? According to Michael Ventrice of the Weather Channel, Irma could easily become a “super typhoon” with “sustained speeds of over 180mph” […]
The scale we have right now really never envisioned storms that powerful.  In fact, some have suggested that we need to add a “category 6” to describe the kind of “super storms” that are now developing in the Atlantic.

A 2015 paper published in Nature Climate Change discussed the prospect of so-called grey swan storms, which the authors defined as “tropical cyclones […] that would not be predicted based on history but may be foreseeable using physical knowledge together with historical data.” 
Using modeling data, the scientists in that study argued that — due to a warming climate — the likelihood of such “grey swan” storms has increased from an essentially negligible level to low but significant level:

Grey swan tropical cyclones striking Tampa, Cairns and Dubai can generate storm surges of about 6 m, 5.7 m and 4 m, respectively, with estimated annual exceedance probabilities [the likelihood of a storm generating surges higher than that] of about 1/10,000. With climate change, these probabilities can increase significantly over the twenty-first century (to 1/3,100–1/1,100 in the middle and 1/2,500–1/700 towards the end of the century for Tampa). Worse grey swan tropical cyclones, inducing surges exceeding 11 m in Tampa and 7 m in Dubai, are also revealed with non-negligible probabilities, especially towards the end of the century.

While Snyder references a blog post that quotes the paper, he does not make it clear that the idea is now two years old — and has nothing to do with Irma. No scientist or meteorologist has suggested that Irma alone is reason to create a new category. 
It is true that Hurricane Irma is a strong and dangerous storm. According to the Washington Post’s Capital Weather Gang, it is “barreling toward the northern Lesser Antilles and Southern Florida [and is] already the strongest hurricane ever recorded outside the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico.” They added that it is “likely to make landfall somewhere in Florida over the weekend.”
However, claims that the size of this specific storm was large enough to spawn discussion of a new hurricane wind category are based on general scientific discussions and not on the strength of Hurricane Irma."

						‘Cancelled’ ICE Raid Raises Questions About Potentially Massive Operation",null,null,"Just days after NBC News reported that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) was planning a massive deportation operation (dubbed “Operation Mega”) for late September 2017 targeting 6,000 to 10,000 undocumented people, ICE released a statement announcing the operation had been cancelled due to catastrophic weather conditions brought on by Hurricanes Harvey and Irma.
In a statement sent to us by email the agency maintained “there is currently no coordinated nationwide operation planned for mid-September.” But both the massive scale of the the aptly-named “Mega” operation and the abrupt cancellation following its revelation in the news through a leaked memo prompted immigrant advocates to question why such a massive operation was scheduled when southern border crossings are at record lows.
Pedro Rios, director of the San Diego office of American Friends Service Committee, a Quaker social justice organization, told us the scope of the operation points to the potential for escalation under a president who started his campaign expressing hostility toward immigrants. For one thing, Rios said, an operation that size is unheard of in recent history which could be a harbinger for things to come:
I don’t remember any operation that was targeting so many people at one time — certainly there were some targeting a couple thousand, but never 8,400 to 10,000 people. When [Attorney General] Jeff Sessions was giving his speech about DACA, he did allude to other things like limiting legal migration as well. So the possibility for further action by the government to target people is definitely a concern.
Enrique Morones, founder of the migrant aid group Border Angels, told us that, despite the cancellation announcement, he doesn’t know what’s going to happen — but rumors are flying, creating heightened fear in the community.
People are on pins and needles, and even if they see law enforcement show up for something which could be unrelated, they think it could be a raid. I don’t know if there’s going to be one or not.
	
		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
In a statement released to reporters, ICE officials said:
Due to the current weather situation in Florida and other potentially impacted areas, along with the ongoing recovery in Texas, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) had already reviewed all upcoming operations and has adjusted accordingly. There is currently no coordinated nationwide operation planned at this time. The priority in the affected areas should remain focused on life-saving and life-sustaining activities.
When we asked for clarification, we received a similarly-worded statement:
[T]here is currently no coordinated nationwide operation planned for mid-September. However, as the statement also makes clear, ICE fugitive operations teams will continue to target and arrest criminal aliens and other individuals who are in violation of our nation’s immigration laws, in non-affected areas of the country, as part of routine operations.
Morones said the wording of the statement left it unclear as to whether aspects of the operation could proceed so long as they were not coordinated nationwide.
Rios told us the Obama administration discouraged “collateral arrests,” or the detention of people encountered by ICE by chance, and who may not be documented but don’t have any criminal records at all. That approach has changed, Rios told us. Although ICE’s public statements seemed to give the impression the agency continues to prioritize those with criminal backgrounds, an official who spoke to NBC News said the operation could result in collateral arrests.
Although it’s unclear whether those captured in any potential raids would be immediately deported, Detention Watch Network policy director Mary Smalls told us ICE has the capacity to detain as many as 42,000 people on any given day due to contracts with mostly-private detention facilities — and many of those contracts include wording that requires a minimum number of detainees to fill beds. But with southern border crossings down to record lows in 2017, Smalls said ICE has had to be more aggressive with raids and detentions in the country’s interior to make up for the decline.
Smalls told us that case-in-point, 70 percent of the people caught up in a July 2017 sweep, which was the second phase of an operation known as “Border Guardian/Border Resolve” were “collateral” arrests — a pattern advocates fear will continue. Smalls told us:
What is written into a lot of these facility contracts is a guarantee that a certain number of people will be detained and if not, ICE will pay them as though they are. The fact the whole thing is based off of a quota system tells you that this is not a self-restraining system. This is a system that’s going to go after as many people as it can."

The site has already shown a tendency to appropriate natural disasters such as Hurricane Irma — which has killed at least 23 people in the United States — for unrelated content, which it then describes as “live footage” and plays on a loop to rack up views.
Both that video and a post featuring a video EBUZZ claimed was a “cloud face” generated by the hurricane appear to have been taken down as of 14 September 2017.
Also, while U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has confirmed crab migrations in the central part of the state, those involve giant land crabs, commonly known as “blue crabs”. The ones featured in EBUZZ.buzz’s video, however, more closely resemble the crustaceans that travel en masse across regions such as Christmas Island or Cuba’s Bay of Pigs on their annual spawning migration.
We reached out to both USFWS and the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission seeking comment, but have yet to hear back."

Although internet commenters pointed out several fishy aspects of this video (for example, the fins don’t ever seem to change directions), the biggest giveaway came from the video’s description:

Although this video was originally posted by YouTube user “ViralVideoLab” along with heavy hints that it was less than authentic, many viewers encountered this footage in articles from outlets like the Daily Star and The Sun, where it was presented with the bare minimum of skepticism. Entertainer Bam Margera also posted this video on social media as if it were real, and a blog post promoted by musician Akon went as far as warning tourists to stay away from Miami because of its new shark problem:
In the wake of Irma, many parts of Miami were so badly flooded that some of the ocean’s residents are now swimming up and down the city’s streets. Among them is none other than the infamous shark. If you thought you only had to worry about sharks while chillin’ at the beach, you might want to think again.
Most of us would be running in the opposite direction if we saw a bunch of sharks swimming around town. However, this brave soul decided to head outside and record the moment. Seriously though, it looks like something straight out of a scary movie — and we all know that scary movies usually don’t end well.
If you’re in Miami, be careful. If you’re not — now certainly isn’t the best time to plan a trip.
Fake videos and images purportedly showing sharks in odd places tend to gain traction in the aftermath of a hurricane. However, it’s unlikely that you’ll spot one of these large marine creatures swimming down the highway (a prank photograph that has reappeared for every hurricane season since 2011) through your neighborhood, or leaping out from a large puddle after a major storm:

As Hurricane Irma hurtles toward Florida and the east coast, you might be afraid of potential shark attacks during the storm — but experts say not to be worried.
[…]
Most sharks are not going to be focused on attacking you during a hurricane, because they want to get themselves to safety, according to Chris Lowe, director of the Shark Lab at California State University, Long Beach.
Sharks — and other fish — are sensitive to barometric pressure, which drops when a storm comes in, Lowe says. Research has shown sharks can feel the change in pressure and swim toward deeper water where they’ll be safer. “Most animals will get nature’s alerts and leave,” Lowe says.
Even animals that aren’t as sensitive to the changes in barometric pressure will likely leave for deeper water when they see other animals do so. This is similar to how humans behave before a hurricane — if people see their neighbors evacuating before the storm hits, they may follow suit.

“ViralVideoLab” wasn’t the first prankster to use a fake shark fin to fool internet users. A very similar video was created in October 2015, after Hurricane Joaquin brought heavy rains to Ocean City, Maryland."

						Was Hillary Clinton Caught on Tape Laughing About Irma’s ‘Wiping Out All of Those Florida Hillbillies?‘","Hillary Clinton made fun of hurricane Irma victims and called them ""Florida hillbillies.""","False
					
						
							About this rating","The web site AsAmericanAsApplePie.org published a story in September 2017 that painted former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton as behaving callously toward victims of hurricane Irma:
While filming a segment for The Rachel Maddow Show on MSNBC, Hillary Rodham Clinton was nabbed on tape saying the most awful thing imaginable about Hurricane Irma and its potential victims:
“To be honest, Rachel, it would probably be good for the country if Irma were to just wipe every Florida hillbilly off the map. I mean…they live in trailers by the water, right?”
The remark was allegedly captured on tape by a “true patriot” sound engineer who vowed to hold on to it unless he needed to “save the country” or himself.
The story is fabricated, as is every story on the site. Its Facebook page includes this disclaimer:
Nothing on this page is real. It is a collection of the satirical whimsies of liberal trolls masquerading as conservatives. You have been warned.
	
		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
The same disclaimer also appears verbatim on the Facebook page for another fake news site, TheLastLineofDefense.org, and the two web sites appear to be related. 
As American As Apple Pie also has another, more vaguely-worded, disclaimer on its web site:
When no one can trust the lying fake news liberal media anymore because they hate us and guns and Harley Davidson and meat and OUR president, As American as Apple Pie is here to be your beacon of something you can kinda rely on sometimes, but not really because only God can control our fate in this crazy, twisted world. God Bless America and Amen.

						Floridians Can Obtain Food Stamp Benefits If Their Power Went Out During Hurricane Irma?","Florida residents affected by Hurricane Irma can receive $197 in food stamp benefits, but only if they can show that their homes lost power for more than two hours.","Mostly False
					
						
							About this rating","In September 2017, Facebook users spread several rumors about government benefits and assistance available to Florida residents in the aftermath of Hurricane Irma. One of these rumors involved the provision of food stamps for Floridians whose homes had experienced power outages of at least two hours in duration.
A typical expression of the rumor read as follows:
#FLORIDA
If your power was out for more than two hours. You are eligible for food stamps. $197.00 per person. Go to www.myflorida.com/accessflorida … Apply for benefits..create an account. Click on food stamps or snaps..DO NOT APPLY FOR CASH…Make sure you have a valid phone number so they can verify your zip code…
A similar rumor claimed that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), rather than the state of Florida, was overseeing food stamp benefits:
FEMA assistance is available to those whose power was out for more than 2 hours they’re eligible for food stamps 197 per person go to myflorida.com Access Florida apply for benefits create an account click food stamps or snaps do not apply for cash make sure you have valid phone number so they can verify zip code.
	
		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
A separate but related rumor held that FEMA was directly providing Floridians with $500 for food purchases:
For those in need

FEMA is giving $500 direct deposit that can be used for food. Apply at disasterassistance.gov

FEMA 1-800-621-3362 or 1-800-462-7585
None of these rumors was quite right, and they all seemed to be based on misunderstandings of a federal disaster relief program known as Disaster-SNAP (or D-SNAP), which was extended to parts of Florida on 22 September 2017.
D-SNAP is a program that temporarily extends the benefits usually available under SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly known as food stamps) to individuals affected by natural disasters. One does not have to be an existing recipient of SNAP benefits in order to qualify for D-SNAP, but the latter program does incorporate maximum income limits. D-SNAP assistance typically lasts for one month, but Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue announced on 22 September that the program would be in place for two months in Florida.
Recipients are provided with a temporary EBT card containing an amount of credit based upon household size and income.
A one-person household with a gross monthly income of $1,664 or less would receive $194 in D-SNAP credit for one month (a figure that may be the source of the “$197 per person” claim in some Facebook rumors). An eight-person household (provided it has a gross monthly income of $4,151 or less) would be eligible to receive $1,169 in D-SNAP assistance (an average of $146 per person). A two-person household (provided it met the income requirements) would be eligible for $357 in benefits, or $179.50 per person. (There is no set benefit amount per person, a common element of the rumors which is misleading.)
The extension of D-SNAP in Florida applies to certain counties. A county is considered eligible based upon the percentage of power outages experienced over a period of 72 hours, as well as the level of structural and flood damage suffered.
So power outages do play a role in the provision of extended SNAP benefits, but only on the county level. Such benefits come with no requirement that an individual household must have experienced a power outage for “more than two hours,” or that applicants must provide photographic evidence of such outages.		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
The appropriate place to apply for Disaster-SNAP assistance in Florida is the ACCESS Florida web page. 
Other assistance is available
As well as Disaster-SNAP, existing food stamp recipients can avail themselves of certain other enhanced benefits in light of the damage and disruption caused by Hurricane Irma. 
According to the United States Department of Agriculture’s Food and Nutrition Service, which oversees SNAP, regular Florida recipients can (as of 12 September 2017) temporarily use EBT cards to buy hot food (something they cannot normally do) and should have received their monthly allotment earlier than usual in September:
USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) recently approved a temporary waiver and supported other actions that will help households participating in the USDA’s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) in Florida, Georgia, and the Virgin Islands, and the Nutrition Assistance Program in Puerto Rico, to access food in the wake of Hurricane Irma, including:

Allowing SNAP participants in Florida to buy hot foods and hot ready-to-eat foods with their benefits through Sept. 30.
Supporting Florida’s plan to issue all September SNAP benefits on Sept. 7 and Georgia’s plan to issue all remaining benefits for September on Sept. 10; both actions will ensure families have access to their monthly benefits sooner during this time of immediate crisis.


In addition to these modifications, several types of federally-provided assistance are available to those affected by disasters such as Hurricanes Irma and Harvey, both in Florida and in other states. These benefits include monetary assistance with rent and home repairs as well as funeral and medical care costs, as well as direct assistance such as FEMA’s entering into lease agreements with owners of multi-family rental properties and performing repairs, with the aim of providing temporary accommodation for individuals.
Variations in eligibility, rates of payment, duration of assistance, and type of assistance mean that it’s virtually impossible to say how much an individual household or person might receive. Residents of states that have been affected by hurricanes and other disasters can check whether they are eligible for federal assistance, and apply for such assistance, by visiting DisasterAssistance.gov. 
The claim asserted in one of the Facebook rumors, that FEMA is offering individuals $500 via direct deposit to be used for purchasing food, has a grain of truth to it.
As part of the assistance that the federal government provides to individuals and households in state where major disasters have been declared (as was the case in Florida), individuals who have lost their homes or been displaced can apply for what’s known as Critical Needs Assistance, which consists of a one-time payment of $500, as explained by FEMA:
FEMA may provide financial assistance to individuals and households who, as a result of the disaster, have immediate or critical needs because they are displaced from their primary dwelling. Immediate or critical needs are life-saving and life-sustaining items including, but not limited to: water, food, first aid, prescriptions, infant formula, diapers, consumable medical supplies, durable medical equipment, personal hygiene items, and fuel for transportation … It is a one-time $500 payment per household.
However, the state must first ask FEMA to authorize Critical Needs Assistance in specific counties particularly badly hit by a disaster, FEMA must then grant that authorization, and the individual must go through an application process. FEMA has authorized Critical Needs Assistance in certain Florida counties, which are listed on the FEMA web site.
The Critical Needs Assistance application is available only to individuals who have lost their homes or been displaced, and who had previously resided in counties where FEMA has authorized Critical Needs Assistance."

						Trump: ‘I Don’t Believe’ Government Climate Report Finding",null,"This article is republished here with permission from The Associated Press. This content is shared here because the topic may interest Snopes readers; it does not, however, represent the work of Snopes fact-checkers or editors.","WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump on Monday rejected a central conclusion of a dire report on the economic costs of climate change released by his own administration.
But economists said the National Climate Assessment’s warning of hundreds of billions of dollars a year in global warming costs is pretty much on the money.
Just look at last year with Hurricanes Harvey, Maria and Irma, they said. Those three 2017 storms caused at least $265 billion in damage , according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
The climate report, quietly unveiled Friday, warned that natural disasters are worsening in the United States because of global warming.
It said warming-charged extremes “have already become more frequent, intense, widespread or of long duration.” The report noted the last few years have smashed U.S. records for damaging weather, costing nearly $400 billion since 2015.
	
		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
“The potential for losses in some sectors could reach hundreds of billions of dollars per year by the end of this century,” the report said. It added that if emissions of heat-trapping gases continue at current levels, labor costs in outdoor industries during heat waves could cost $155 billion in lost wages per year by 2090.
The president said he read some of the report “and it’s fine” but not the part about the devastating economic impact.
“I don’t believe it,” Trump said, adding that if “every other place on Earth is dirty, that’s not so good.”
Nearly every country in the world in 2015 pledged to reduce or slow the growth of carbon dioxide emissions, the chief greenhouse gas.
“We’re already there,” said Wesleyan University economist Gary Yohe, who was a reviewer of the national report, which was produced by 13 federal agencies and outside scientists. “Climate change is making a noticeable impact on our economy right now: Harvey, Florence, Michael, Maria.”
Yohe said, “It is devastating at particular locations, but for the entire country? No.”
Economist Ray Kopp, a vice president at the think tank Resources For the Future and who wasn’t part of the assessment, said the economics and the science in the report were absolutely credible.
“I believe this is going to be a devastating loss without any other action-taking place,” Kopp said Monday. “This is certainly something you would want to avoid.”		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
Earlier, the White House had played down the report. Spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said in an emailed statement that the report “is largely based on the most extreme scenario, which contradicts long-established trends by assuming that, despite strong economic growth that would increase greenhouse gas emissions, there would be limited technology and innovation, and a rapidly expanding population. ”
Throughout the 29-chapter report, scientists provide three scenarios that the United Nations’ climate assessments use. One is the business-as-usual scenario, which scientists say is closest to the current situation. That is the worst case of the three scenarios. Another would envision modest reductions in heat-trapping gases, and the third would involve severe cuts in carbon dioxide pollution.
For example, the $155 billion a year in extra labor costs at the end of the century is under the business-as-usual scenario. Modest reductions in carbon pollution would cut that to $75 billion a year, the report said.
The report talks of hundreds of billions of dollars in economic losses in several spots. In one graphic, it shows the worst-case business-as-usual scenario of economic costs reaching 10 percent of gross domestic product when Earth is about a dozen degrees warmer than now with no specific date.
Yohe said it was unfortunate that some media jumped on that 10 percent number because that was a rare case of hyperbole in the report.
“The 10 percent is not implausible as a possible future for 2100,” Yohe said. “It’s just not terribly likely.”
Kopp, on the other hand, said the 10 percent figure seems believable.
“This is probably a best estimate,” Kopp said. “It could be larger. It could be smaller.”"

						Is It Illegal in Florida to Power Your Home With Solar After a Storm Because of Lobbying?","Thanks to lobbying, Florida homeowners were unable to use solar panels during Irma to generate electricity.","False
					
						
							About this rating","In the days immediately following Hurricane Irma making landfall in Florida in early September 2017, many Floridians lost electrical power — including those with solar panels. Shortly after the powerful storm hit, the alternative weekly newspaper Miami New Times offered an explanation as to why those with solar panels, who seemingly should be unaffected by a utility grid failure so long as there is sunlight, were also, quite literally, in the dark.  
In a 14 September 2017 article, the New Times reported that thanks to lobbying, the utilities company Florida Power & Light (FPL) had so much undue leverage over when and whether customers could make use of solar panels that they were able to prevent solar users from accessing sun-based electricity in Irma’s aftermath. The New Times reported:
FPL’s lobbying wing has fought hard against letting Floridians power their own homes with solar panels. Thanks to power-company rules, it’s impossible across Florida to simply buy a solar panel and power your individual home with it. You are instead legally mandated to connect your panels to your local electric grid.
More egregious, FPL mandates that if the power goes out, your solar-power system must power down along with the rest of the grid, robbing potentially needy people of power during major outages.
Although the “big corporate government/axis of evil” narrative was too juicy for many conspiracy sites to pass up, Floridians are not, in fact, mandated by law to connect solar panels to the power grid. Utility providers are instead required to allow customers to connect their solar panels to the grid for “net metering,” meaning they can enjoy lower utility bills if their homes generate more power than they use, because excess power is sold back to the utility company. Florida statute actually makes it unlawful for any entity block residents from having solar panels.
Further, FPL doesn’t “mandate” that solar panels power down if the grid goes offline in a crisis. This is a safety precaution and industry-wide standard put in place to prevent line workers from being electrocuted while restoring power during an outage — and it is not unique to Florida. The “mandate” cited by the New Times is in fact a guideline which reflects this standard and includes an important caveat. The guideline reads (emphasis added):
Renewable generator systems connected to the grid without batteries are not a standby power source during an FPL outage. The system must shut down when FPL’s grid shuts down in order to prevent dangerous back feed on FPL’s grid. This is required to protect FPL employees who may be working on the grid.
	
		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
We asked Patrick Altier, owner of the Florida-based energy company Solar Trek, to explain further. Altier told us that Floridians who have solar panels on their homes can use energy from the sun during a grid failure — if they purchase additional equipment to prevent volts of electricity from traveling through power lines and harming unsuspecting neighbors or repair crews. To illustrate this, he gave us two scenarios:
In my home, I have a grid-type solar system, meaning when the grid shuts down my solar shuts off. The reason for that is simply common sense and safety. [If it didn’t shut off] I’d be back-feeding up to 600 volts to the utility lines, and a linesman could get killed. Electricity is like water — it takes the path of least resistance. So there’s a current that, if it’s not being used by my home, could back-feed down the utility line for a long ways and be potentially life threatening.
The other scenario is, at my office, I have a solar system that’s called a battery-interactive system. When the grid goes down, a transfer switch switches me off the grid and into the battery system, so there’s no way I could back-feed and hurt a utility linesman.
What’s happening [with these news stories] is, they’re taking something that was designed as a safety feature and they’re trying to make it look like the utilities are the bad guys when they’re just trying to keep their employees safe.
The reason many homeowners don’t have the additional equipment necessary to allow them to keep their power on when the grid is down is because of the purchasing cost, said Mark Bubriski, director of public affairs for FPL. However, if customers have installed a battery system, such as a Tesla Powerwall or an SMA Sunny Island, they can use their solar panels safely during a grid failure. No laws or mandates prohibit them from doing so.
Conspiratorial theorizing about living off-grid is not new and tends to be popular, perhaps because it plays on the always-present American distrust of both governmental and corporate overreach. That perhaps explains why the New Times story struck a nerve — it reports, for example, that “FPL is… allowed to disconnect your panels from the grid without warning you. The company can even put a padlock on it.” It also reports that utilities companies can “charge a $400 or $1,000 application fee for consumers who want to install systems more powerful than 10 kilowatts.”  
These are not misleading characterizations, but they make mundane operations seem ominous, Bubriski said. Technically, FPL can shut off power without warning for safety reasons, such as in the case of a fire or other hazard. FPL can also padlock certain inverters on large systems with manual shutoff switches to ensure the only ones able to access it are FPL workers. He also explained that the application fees, particularly the higher ones, wouldn’t affect most customers because the tiered fees only come into play for systems twice the size of the average Florida home.
That is not to say FPL hasn’t been criticized — and as with any topic of public interest, there are legitimate concerns to be raised. For example, some have criticized the speed with which FPL restored power after Irma (as of 25 September 2017, all FPL customers who lost power during Irma have been brought back online). And FPL and the local industry at large have been dragged for drafting what critics call favorable legislation. These stories, however, aren’t as clickable as the big-government-big-corporate conglomerate robbing the American public of free energy, which may explain why that is the one that made national headlines despite its mendacity."

						Are Hotels Required to Accept Pets During Natural Disasters?","The federal government, either through the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) or the 2006 PETS law allows pet owners to bring their pets to any hotel or motel during weather-related evacuations.","Mostly False
					
						
							About this rating","In late August and early September 2017, the approach of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma prompted social media claims that the federal government, either through a 2006 law or through the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), mandated that pets be allowed to accompany disaster evacuees into hotels and motels.
A typical expression of the claim read:
ATTENTION: If you are evacuating to a hotel/motel and they say they DON’T accept pets, don’t get ugly, but simply tell them that is against the law & FEMA established that after Hurricane Katrina!
The Pets Evacuation and Transportation Standards Act (PETS) was a bi-partisan initiative in the United States House of Representatives to require states seeking Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) assistance to accommodate pets and service animals in their plans for evacuating residents facing disasters.
DONT SHARE, COPY AND PASTE SO MORE PEOPLE READ THIS!”
The Pets Evacuation and Transportation Standards Act of 2006 essentially requires that FEMA take into account the needs of pet owners when developing disaster preparedness plans, and it also authorizes the director of the agency to fund emergency shelter facilities which can accommodate displaced persons with pets and service animals, but it makes no mention of requirements placed on hotels or motels:
Pets Evacuation and Transportation Standards Act of 2006
Amends the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act to require the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to ensure that state and local emergency preparedness operational plans address the needs of individuals with household pets and service animals prior to, during, and following a major disaster or emergency.
Authorizes the Director to: (1) study and develop plans that take into account the needs of individuals with pets and service animals prior to, during, and following a major disaster or emergency; and (2) make financial contributions, on the basis of programs or projects approved by the Director, to the states and local authorities for animal emergency preparedness purposes, including the procurement, construction, leasing, or renovating of emergency shelter facilities and materials that will accommodate people with pets and service animals.
Authorizes federal agencies to provide, as assistance essential to meeting threats to life and property resulting from a major disaster, rescue, care, shelter, and essential needs to individuals with household pets and service animals and to such pets and animals.
	
		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
The “Rumors” section of FEMA’s website now specifically addresses this issue and notes that the rumor about hotels and motels being legally required to accommodate pets is false:
There are reports that hotels and motels participating in the Transitional Sheltering Assistance Program are legally required to accommodate pets. This is FALSE. (September 8)
Hotels and motels participating in FEMA’s Transitional Sheltering Assistance Program do not fall under the Pets Evacuation and Transportation Standards (PETS) Act (Pub. L. 109-308 (2006)). Please call the hotel before you go and ask if pets are permitted.
Hotels must accept service animals and individuals with access and functional needs should check with the hotel to ensure if accessible lodging accommodations are available to meet their needs.
In preparation for Tropical Storm Irene, FEMA advised pet owners to “locate several ‘pet-friendly’ hotels” but made no mention of any purported requirement for all hotels to accommodate pets:
Planning for animal evacuation:

If you must leave your residence, have a plan for your family pets;
Go online and locate several “pet-friendly” hotels in and out of your area;
Identify friends or relatives outside your area where you and your pets can stay;
If there is a disaster pending, evacuate early with your pets, working animals and livestock; don’t wait for a mandatory evacuation order; and
Animals should have leg bands or tattoos, microchips or identification tags with their name as well as your address and phone number.


FEMA’s other guides for pet owners also make no mention of the purported requirement.
However, disabled people who use service animals do have the law on their side when they check into hotels. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) makes service animals legally exempt from any hotel “pet policies.
Bottom line: no law requires hotels to accommodate household pets during a natural disaster. Pet owners should plan accordingly."

						Did Puerto Rico’s Teamsters Union Go on Strike During Hurricane Maria Relief Efforts?","In September 2017, truck drivers' unions in Puerto Rico went on strike and refused to take part in relief efforts after a series of hurricanes.","False
					
						
							About this rating","With Puerto Rico experiencing a humanitarian and infrastructural crisis in the aftermath of a series of hurricanes, a flurry of stories appeared at the end of September 2017 falsely claiming that a local union representing truck drivers had gone on strike, using the devastation to leverage an improvement in their pay and working conditions. 
On 30 September 2017, the Conservative Treehouse blog quoted extensively (but selectively) from comments given to the Huffington Post by United States Air Force Colonel Michael Valle:
“The aid is getting to Puerto Rico. The problem is distribution. The federal government has sent us a lot of help; moving those supplies, in particular, fuel, is the issue right now,” says Col. Valle. Until power can be restored, generators are critical for hospitals and shelter facilities and more. But, and it’s a big but, they can’t get the fuel to run the generators.
They have the generators, water, food, medicine, and fuel on the ground, yet the supplies are not moving across the island as quickly as they’re needed.
“It’s a lack of drivers for the transport trucks, the 18 wheelers. Supplies we have. Trucks we have. There are ships full of supplies backed up in the ports, waiting to have a vehicle to unload into. However, only 20% of the truck drivers show up to work. These are private citizens in Puerto Rico, paid by companies that are contracted by the government,” says Col. Valle. 
The Conservative Treehouse then went on to claim, again falsely, that the cause of this shortfall in truck drivers was a deliberate, coordinated strike action by the local Teamsters union. Similar claims were also made by the Gateway Pundit and entrepreneur Kambree Kawahine Koa.
The International Brotherhood of Teamsters rejected these claims entirely, telling us the reports were “fake news” and adding that the Teamsters Local 901 in Puerto Rico was “doing everything but refuse to help” in relief efforts. 
	
		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
In a statement, Teamsters General President Jim Hoffa called the reports “nothing but lies”:
These viral stories spreading across the internet are nothing but lies perpetrated by anti-union entities to further their destructive agenda. The fact that they are attempting to capitalize on the suffering of millions of citizens in Puerto Rico that are in dire need of our help by pushing these false stories, just exposes their true nature.
On 29 September 2017, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters issued a plea for help to members throughout the mainland United States, describing the efforts being made by local truck drivers in Puerto Rico, in the face of infrastructural devastation:
The Teamsters are doing what they can to improve the lives of our members there. That includes working with Joint Council 16 as well as Local 901 leadership in San Juan to identify ways how the union can help. The Teamsters are also joining together with labor unions from across the nation to identify skilled workers to travel to Puerto Rico next week to provide much needed support in critical areas.
There is currently a need for volunteer truck drivers who hold a Commercial Driver’s License (CDL) to transport shipping containers from the port to distribution centers throughout the island. Additionally, the Teamsters Freight, Airline, Passenger Transport, Package, Public Services and Waste Divisions are contacting Teamster employers that operate in Puerto Rico and our local unions throughout the U.S. and Canada to identify avenues of support and volunteers. 
At this time, it is unclear if there are trucks available to move the containers, fuel to operate the trucks or road access to the distribution centers. However, the labor movement is working on the ground in Puerto Rico to bring volunteers to meet specific needs.
Indeed, Colonel Michael Valle — one of the sources cited by the Conservative Treehouse — went on to tell the Huffington Post:
There should be zero blame on the drivers. They can’t get to work, the infrastructure is destroyed, they can’t get fuel themselves, and they can’t call us for help because there’s no communication. The will of the people of Puerto Rico is off the charts. The truck drivers have families to take care of, many of them have no food or water. They have to take care of their family’s needs before they go off to work, and once they do go, they can’t call home. [Emphasis added].
A CNBC report cited in the Conservative Treehouse post also undermines the claim that there was a strike. As the reporter explains:
There are 3,000 cargo containers here at Crowley, one of the biggest shippers in Puerto Rico…Here’s the problem – the truck drivers can’t get to the terminal to get their containers out…You’re looking at truck drivers who can’t be reached by their businesses by cell phone, they don’t have the gas to get to work, and then even when they do get to work, their semi-trucks don’t have fuel. The problem is the supply chain.		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
Contrary to all this, the Conservative Treehouse claims that the local Teamsters union, which the article (again, falsely) identifies as Frente Amplio, “is refusing to move the product.” A spokesperson for the International Brotherhood of Teamsters confirmed that Frente Amplio is an independent truck drivers’ union in Puerto Rico and is not affiliated with the Teamsters in any way. 
In any event, the Conservative Treehouse cites a Wapa TV interview with Victor Rodriguez, President of Frente Amplio, as evidence of a strike by truck drivers. In fact, it is evidence of no such thing. In the interview, Rodriguez criticizes Puerto Rico’s governor Ricardo Rosselló for a law he signed in April that changed how truck drivers obtain permits, but he does not declare strike action or a refusal to work on the part of Frente Amplio members. He says:
The truckers are doing what they need to do. The one not doing what he needs to do is the governor.
Rodriguez states that his organization had actually called off a planned strike before the arrival of Hurricane Irma, which caused widespread infrastructural damage to Puerto Rico in early September. 
The governor of Puerto Rico was lucky — three weeks before Irma there was going to be a strike because of the law he passed.
At one point, Rodriguez does point to the power and leverage held by his members, saying:
The power is with the truckers. If the truckers don’t move, this country won’t move for two years.
However, he does not declare a strike or refusal to work and affirms “the truckers are going to work,” in this exchange with Wapa TV’s Eliezer Ramos:
Ramos: Are you telling me that truck drivers are not reporting to work because of a law?

Rodriguez: No, we’re doing what we need to do.

Ramos: But you just said that because of a law –

Rodriguez: No, excuse me, the truckers are going to work, and I expect truck drivers in the country to keep working with the people, who made it possible for us to use the roads.
Puerto Rico’s Teamsters Local 901 are not on strike or refusing to work, and they are in fact pleading with truck drivers on the United States mainland to help in the distribution of fuel and supplies there.
The Conservative Treehouse’s claims about this are based on cherry-picked quotes from a United States Air Force Colonel and a CNBC reporter, both of whose full remarks make clear that truck drivers in Puerto Rico are hampered by severe problems with infrastructure and distribution, but are not refusing to work. 
On 2 October 2017, a government spokesperson also refuted the rumor in an interview posted by CBS News reporter David Begnaud on Twitter saying, “Everyone’s working and the supplies are getting to where they have to.”"

							About this rating","The more often one speaks in public, the greater the odds one will be caught making an embarrassing flub. This applies to heads of state no less than the rest of us.
A statement uttered by President Trump in late 2017 (and is still making the online rounds) seemed to show confusion on his part as to whether his presidency extended to United States territories such as the Virgin Islands, Guam, and Puerto Rico. The quote — “I met with the president of the Virgin Islands” — is frequently shared as a sarcastic meme on social media:
<img loading=""lazy"" class=""aligncenter wp-image-163320"" style=""border: 1px solid black;"" src=""https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2018/09/trump-virgin-islands.jpg"" alt=""I met with the president of the U.S. Virgin Islands"" width=""600"" height=""817"" data-recalc-dims=""1"" srcset=""https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2018/09/trump-virgin-islands.jpg?resize=880%2C1199&amp;zoom=1 880w, https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2018/09/trump-virgin-islands.jpg?resize=880%2C1199&amp;zoom=0.5 440w, https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2018/09/trump-virgin-islands.jpg?resize=880%2C1199&amp;zoom=0.25 220w"" sizes=""(max-width: 880px) 100vw, 880px"" />
The occasion was the 2017 Values Voter Summit, which took place at the Omni Shoreham Hotel in Washington, D.C., on 13 October. President Trump opened his speech by offering condolences to the victims of the mass shooting two weeks earlier in Las Vegas, Nevada, and expressing solidarity with those affected by recent natural disasters, including the victims of Hurricane Irma and Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands:
<span data-mce-type=""bookmark"" style=""display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;"" class=""mce_SELRES_start"">﻿</span><span data-mce-type=""bookmark"" style=""display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;"" class=""mce_SELRES_start"">﻿</span><span data-mce-type=""bookmark"" style=""display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;"" class=""mce_SELRES_start"">﻿</span>
We also stand with the millions of people who have suffered from the massive fires which are right now raging in California, and the catastrophic hurricanes along the Gulf Coast, in Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and I will tell you, I left Texas, and I left Florida, and I left Louisiana, and I went to Puerto Rico and I met with the President of the Virgin Islands. These are people that are incredible people. They suffered gravely, and we’ll be there, we’re going to be there …
The president was referring to the governor of the U.S. Virgin Islands, Kenneth Mapp, with whom he met in early October of that year. Although it’s not strictly accurate to say, as claimed in the meme, that Trump himself is “the president of the Virgin Islands” (any more than it is to say that Trump is “the president of California”), his presidency does encompass that and other U.S. territories. In diplomatic parlance, Trump is the “head of state” of the Virgin Islands, while the governor is its “head of government.”
Trump indeed misspoke when he called Mapp the president of the Virgin Islands instead of referring to him as its governor, but there are no grounds for assuming he didn’t know the difference. In a tweet issued on 3 October 2017, ten days before his speech at the Values Voter Summit, Trump correctly referenced the governor and his title:

One popular — and ancient — theory accuses the United States of engaging in “weather warfare” by using the Alaska-based High-Frequency Active Auroral Research Program (HAARP) to create them. HAARP is another frequent conspiracy theory bugaboo, supposedly involved in everything from making hurricanes to mind control.
Skeptics point out that HAARP is a low-frequency transmitter that has no power to make hurricanes or enslave minds. Beyond that, HAARP is no longer a government facility, having been donated to the University of Alaska Fairbanks in 2015. Presumably, if HAARP was a devastating weapon of weather war, the government wouldn’t just give it away.
On the other side of the spectrum, one conservative commentator tried to write the storms off as fake news, trumped up to push a climate change agenda and sell bottled water. This was the theory pushed by Rush Limbaugh, who claimed Hurricane Irma was far weaker than initial reports claimed — only to evacuate himself a few days later.

After a man on the Las Vegas Strip opened fire on 1 October 2017, killing nearly 60 people and injuring hundreds more, rumors immediately began flying: one held that there were multiple shooters firing from several floors, another that the security guard was an accomplice (which culminated in far-right self-described reporters banging on his door, camping out in front of his house, and ultimately reporting, completely falsely, that he had gone missing), and yet another, as happens with all mass shootings in the United States, that the incident was a hoax featuring paid actors posing as victims in an effort to take away gun rights.

All of these were quickly debunked, though the shooter’s motive remains a mystery. A month later, the Clark County Sheriff told the Los Angeles Times that the shooter was a high-rolling gambler who had lost a “significant amount of wealth,” and had shown growing signs of mental instability. Even so, conspiracy theories continue to make the rounds, including one alleging that survivors of the shooting are being systematically murdered.		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
Antifa
Conspiracy theories have linked the anti-fascist activists known as “antifa” to a number of violent acts that either didn’t take place at all, or that had nothing to do with the activists.
One rumor that went far and wide was sparked by a viral video made by an amateur bounty hunter wearing an iron-on patch on his sweatshirt that vaguely resembled a law enforcement badge.  He predicted (completely wrongly) that antifa “super-soldiers” would go house to house on 4 November 2017, stealing guns and killing white people in the name of resisting Trump.

Conspiracy theorists also linked antifa to both the Las Vegas shooting and the mass shooting in Texas a month later, despite no evidence existing that either shooter was part of any anti-fascist movement — or even sympathized with them.
Online commentators also tried to connect a train derailment near Olympia, Washington, to an eight-month-old blog post by a self-proclaimed Antifa group that said they had poured concrete on train tracks 15 miles away from the scene of the accident. As it turned out, the train had been traveling nearly three times the speed limit as it went around a dangerous curve.
Bitcoin
It shouldn’t be surprising that the online crypto-currency Bitcoin is a prolific generator of rumors and scams. After all, nobody knows who developed it, few people understand how it works, and its value swings wildly due to nebulous factors controlled by unknown forces. This means, of course, that it’s a topic that’s ripe for conspiracy theories.

So what’s really going on here? As Bitcoin value soared, one financialanalystwrote:
Governments are currently in the process of vetting the cryptocurrency space and using bitcoin as its primary test case … before crushing private cryptocurrencies altogether, then replacing them with one government-sanctioned “bitcoin.”
Other popular Bitcoin conspiracy theories in 2017: that its mysterious inventor is actually the NSA or Elon Musk, that an advanced artificial intelligence created it to take over the world, and that a few “whales” are hoarding Bitcoin to drive up the value of their own holdings.  
But the most likely explanation for high Bitcoin value is that it’s a hype-driven bubble that will level off once the public moves on — a speculative asset craze that’s taken place many other times in history.
Obama’s Shadow Government
Is Barack Obama controlling a “deep state” of bureaucrats and intelligence officials running a mini government to take down the Trump administration?

That’s the thinking behind an “Obama shadow government” working to destroy Trump. Conservative pundits and politicians have freely accused the former president and his appointees of leaking embarrassing information, rigging the Russia investigation, and planning nothing less than a coup through the FBI to throw Trump out of office. There is no evidence for any of these claims.
Roy Moore
The shocking allegations that Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore either had or attempted sexual relations with numerous teenage girls were obvious fodder for conspiracy theories. They arose nearly instantaneously, holding that either the Washington Post was lying or Moore’s accusers were, and that the yearbook signature Moore bestowed on one of the accusers was forged.
<img class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-117371"" style=""border: 1px solid black;"" src=""https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/12/Vote-Roy-Moore.jpg?w=800"" alt="""" width=""800"" data-recalc-dims=""1"" srcset=""https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/12/Vote-Roy-Moore.jpg?resize=600%2C448&amp;zoom=1 600w, https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/12/Vote-Roy-Moore.jpg?resize=600%2C448&amp;zoom=0.5 300w, https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/12/Vote-Roy-Moore.jpg?resize=600%2C448&amp;zoom=0.25 150w"" sizes=""(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"" />
Soon, a fake tweet surfaced accusing Post journalists of offering a thousand dollars for accusations. Meanwhile, someone pretending to be a Post reporter (with an anti-Semitic fake name and a strange attempt at a New York accent) cold-called people in Alabama to offer money for damaging information about the candidate. Moore himself fueled the theorizing, speculating that financier (and favorite bugbear of conspiracy theorists everywhere) George Soros was “trying to alter the voting populous” through pushing a “sexual” agenda.
Even after Moore lost the election, he leaned on conspiracy theories to explain the outcome, posting a Facebook message requesting money to investigate “reported cases of voter fraud and irregularities.” Naturally, bottom-of-the-barrel conspiracy-mongering web sites immediately exploited that statement and others like it, publishing sensational (and completely false) “scoops” to bring in as many clicks and views as possible. 
Fake Melania
President Trump was a magnet for conspiracy theories both in opposition to and in support of his administration. But none summed up the ephemeral nature of internet conspiracies like the one claiming a Melania Trump body double had posed next to the President.
<img loading=""lazy"" class=""alignnone wp-image-107384"" style=""border: 1px solid black;"" src=""https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/10/melania_trump_body_double_feature.jpg?resize=800%2C419&#038;crop_strategy=smart"" alt="""" width=""800"" height=""419"" data-recalc-dims=""1"" srcset=""https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/10/melania_trump_body_double_feature.jpg?resize=800%2C419&amp;zoom=1.5#038;crop_strategy=smart 1200w, https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/10/melania_trump_body_double_feature.jpg?resize=800%2C419&amp;zoom=1#038;crop_strategy=smart 800w, https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/10/melania_trump_body_double_feature.jpg?resize=800%2C419&amp;zoom=0.5#038;crop_strategy=smart 400w, https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/10/melania_trump_body_double_feature.jpg?resize=800%2C419&amp;zoom=0.25#038;crop_strategy=smart 200w"" sizes=""(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"" />
The First Lady’s lack of public appearances and seeming aloofness make her an easy subject for gossip and rumors. Sure enough, in October, a Facebook user posted that something seemed “off” about Melania’s appearance as she stood next to the President during a quick appearance in front of reporters. Others then claimed that her nose, hair, and mouth looked different. Soon, social media was alight with rumors that Melania had been “replaced” by a decoy, either to help her avoid the spotlight, or because she’d split up with the president.
The theory relied on a few out-of-context low-quality images apparently taken by someone filming their television screen, and was quickly written off as cynical fake news. But for a few days it captured the attention of almost every major news outlet in the country, some of which covered it straight and others that pointed out how weird it was.
In that regard, it was a perfect example of most of 2017’s conspiracy theories: baseless, bizarre, and ultimately short-lived."

						Did Stan Lee Fire Jennifer Lawrence for Comments About Trump?",Stan Lee fired Jennifer Lawrence from an upcoming film due to his belief she disrespected President Trump.,"False
					
						
							About this rating","After actress Jennifer Lawrence’s comments on hurricanes and climate change were misconstrued by commentators and clickbait web sites in September 2017, the “satire” web site Our Land of the Free followed up with a page claiming the falsely represented comments had earned her a stinging reproach from Stan Lee:
After stupid liberal Jennifer Lawrence made a fool of herself by blaming Hurricane Irma on junk science and Trump supporters, she found out just how “influential” she actually is. She came home from Paris this morning to the news from Universal Worldwide that she will NOT be returning as the beautiful blue “Mystique” in the next chapter of X-Men movies.
Lawrence, a notorious crybaby, is said to have broken down when she heard that the decision came from Stan Lee himself, the mastermind behind the Marvel Universe. Lee told TMZ:
“That young lady needs to learn some respect. Even if you don’t agree with Trump, you still have to respect him and treat him like he’s the President. He called and asked me to fire her, so I fired her. Done.”
The article refers to comments Lawrence made to a British television station in which she said that human activity had caused global warming, and that hurricanes felt like “nature’s wrath.” She also, without referring to Donald Trump by name, said “the only voice we have is through voting.” Several outlets drummed up a nontroversy by claiming she had linked the hurricanes to Trump. 
Stan Lee did not fire Jennifer Lawrence. A disclaimer notice on Our Land of the Free’s About page warned readers that its content is “fake news“ (and the URL not-so-subtly stated “stan-lee-hates-you-idiots”):
Ourlandofthefree.com makes no guarantee that anything you find here will be based at all in reality. All posts should be considered satirical and all images photoshopped to look like something they’re not.

The Jennifer Lawrence page was the second in days from Our Land of the Free using real-life events for the basis of outrage-bait. A similar embellishment spread by the site involved a letter President Obama left for President Trump when he took office."

						2017: The Year in Fauxtography",null,null,"Whether it was news of industry-rattling sexual assault allegations, bloody mass shootings, or images of a white supremacist rally, 2017’s major headlines were shocking — and fake photographs and elaborate hoaxes were sure to follow.
Sometimes these doctored images were shared simply to take advantage of a trending topic. Other times, however, they were shared with the intent of spreading a political or personal agenda. At the very least, some stories only intended to muddy the conversation enough to cast doubt. The fake photographs on this list generally fall into one of two categories: Either they are digitally manipulated images that show something that never happened, or they are authentic photographs that were circulated out of context.
Here are some of the biggest stories of the year and the fake photographs that accompanied them. 
Size Matters
The Trump administration’s first controversy came just hours after the president was sworn into office. The Press Secretary at the time, Sean Spicer, bragged that it was the “largest audience to ever witness an inauguration, period.” However, side-by-side photographs comparing the audiences at Trump’s and Obama’s inaugurations told a different story:
	
		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
<img loading=""lazy"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-120293"" style=""border: 1px solid black;"" src=""https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/12/inauguration-photos.jpg"" alt="""" width=""600"" height=""607"" data-recalc-dims=""1"" srcset=""https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/12/inauguration-photos.jpg?resize=600%2C607&amp;zoom=1 600w, https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/12/inauguration-photos.jpg?resize=600%2C607&amp;zoom=0.5 300w, https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/12/inauguration-photos.jpg?resize=600%2C607&amp;zoom=0.25 150w"" sizes=""(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"" />
It wasn’t too surprising to see the Trump administration start with a flap about crowd size. After all, Trump frequently bragged about the size of his crowds during the campaign season, and we saw several manipulated images purporting to show Bill and Hillary Clinton speaking to abnormally small audiences. This trend continued in 2017, as faux photographs showing crowd sizes at various events were circulated in order to prove that Trump was an unpopular president.
This set of photographs was widely circulated after the Patriots visited the White House in April 2017. Both of these photographs are real. However, the bottom photograph only includes players and coaches, while the top photograph features players, coaches, and staff members:
<img loading=""lazy"" class=""aligncenter wp-image-119519"" style=""border: 1px solid black;"" src=""https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/12/nyt-sports.jpg"" alt="""" width=""600"" height=""773"" data-recalc-dims=""1"" srcset=""https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/12/nyt-sports.jpg?resize=583%2C751&amp;zoom=1 583w, https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/12/nyt-sports.jpg?resize=583%2C751&amp;zoom=0.5 292w, https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/12/nyt-sports.jpg?resize=583%2C751&amp;zoom=0.25 146w"" sizes=""(max-width: 583px) 100vw, 583px"" />
Some Patriots players did decline the invitation to the White House, and some specifically said that they didn’t attend because of the current president. However, “White House fatigue” may have been another factor in the turnout; this was the second time in three years that the Patriots were invited to the White House.
Regardless, the number of players who attended in 2017 was comparable to previous events:

Plane Passengers		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
Just because you have a ticket, doesn’t mean you’ll get to fly.
In April 2017, United Airlines went viral for all of the wrong reasons as a couple of security officers were filmed dragging a kicking and screaming passenger down the aisle of a plane. That incident was very real, and it spawned a series of fake images satirizing the situation.
United Airlines, for instance, did not assemble a new task force:
<img loading=""lazy"" class=""aligncenter wp-image-85506"" style=""border: 1px solid black;"" src=""https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/04/united-airlines.jpg"" alt="""" width=""600"" height=""337"" data-recalc-dims=""1"" srcset=""https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/04/united-airlines.jpg?resize=1024%2C575&amp;zoom=1 1024w, https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/04/united-airlines.jpg?resize=1024%2C575&amp;zoom=0.5 512w, https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/04/united-airlines.jpg?resize=1024%2C575&amp;zoom=0.25 256w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"" />
Southwest did not introduce a new slogan:

And United Airlines did not develop new passenger safety helmets:

NFL Protests
When Colin Kaepernick kneeled in protest during the national anthem before a pre-season game in August 2016, he did so with the intent of highlighting the national conversation about police brutality and inequality. The discourse that followed, however, had little to do with these two subjects.
Instead, many political pundits diverted the conversation to whether it was disrespectful to kneel during the national anthem, positing that National Football League players who “take a knee” were insulting veterans and patriots. Others noted that peaceful protest is a right preserved by the First Amendment, and that the disproportionate criminalization and imprisonment of black people has been a persistent problem that hails back to the days of slavery in the United States.
This controversy was, as such controversies always are, heightened by Internet trolls who shared out-of-context or outright doctored photographs about these protests in order to mock or mislead their political opponents.
This photograph does not show the Army football team protesting the anthem; instead, it shows the Navy football team kneeling in prayer:
<img loading=""lazy"" class=""aligncenter wp-image-119541"" style=""border: 1px solid black;"" src=""https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/12/us-navy-kneeling.jpg"" alt="""" width=""600"" height=""750"" data-recalc-dims=""1"" srcset=""https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/12/us-navy-kneeling.jpg?resize=768%2C960&amp;zoom=1 768w, https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/12/us-navy-kneeling.jpg?resize=768%2C960&amp;zoom=0.5 384w, https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/12/us-navy-kneeling.jpg?resize=768%2C960&amp;zoom=0.25 192w"" sizes=""(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px"" />
An image purportedly showing an NFL player burning an American flag also went viral. That image, of course, was fake:

Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers was also dragged into the discourse when a photograph purportedly showing him holding a t-shirt reading “Stand For the Flag, Kneel for the Cross” went viral:
<img loading=""lazy"" class=""aligncenter wp-image-104812"" style=""border: 1px solid black;"" src=""https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/09/aaron-rodgers.jpg"" alt="""" width=""600"" height=""597"" data-recalc-dims=""1"" srcset=""https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/09/aaron-rodgers.jpg?resize=851%2C847&amp;zoom=1 851w, https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/09/aaron-rodgers.jpg?resize=851%2C847&amp;zoom=0.5 426w, https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/09/aaron-rodgers.jpg?resize=851%2C847&amp;zoom=0.25 213w"" sizes=""(max-width: 851px) 100vw, 851px"" />
The real image was almost completely different, showing not this player or message, but musician George Strait holding a shirt that reads “Straight Shootin’ Country Boy.”
Islamophobia
President Donald Trump campaigned on tougher immigration policies, signing an executive order banning travel from seven predominately Muslim countries almost immediately after his election. This executive order faced harsh scrutiny, and was initially blocked by a federal judge. As the travel bans were debated throughout the year, it gave trolls ample time to spread inaccurate and misleading material about Muslims.
One video (which has since been deleted) was shared with the fearmongering title “France has Fallen,” along with the claim that it showed Muslim refugees rioting in France. Although the video is real, it has little to do with Muslims or refugees, instead showing people protesting after a police officer in France reportedly sodomized a young man with his baton:

A similarly out-of-context video was shared with the claim that it shows Muslims marching for Shariah law in England. In reality, it is an annual religious procession for the annual Ashoura observation. 
Another genuine piece of media that reappeared with a fabricated backstory involved a group of people burning an American flag. Although this image was shared as if it documented an incident outside of a New York mosque in 2017, the photograph actually shows people in Bangladesh burning an American flag during a demonstration against the anti-Islam short film “The Innocence of Muslims” that sparked worldwide protests in 2012:

It wouldn’t be proper disinformation without a mention of President Barack Obama, who has been accused of being a secret Muslim by trolls and detractors for many years. As President Trump moved into the White House, misleading articles appeared on many sites, reporting — falsely — that Trump’s staffers had found various Muslim symbols throughout the historic residency, including a sink used for wudu (a way for Muslim worshipers to perform ablutions or wash themselves before prayer, misspelled in the hoax articles as “wada”), Arabic calligraphy over a bed, and prayer mats:
<img loading=""lazy"" class=""aligncenter wp-image-89095"" style=""border: 1px solid black;"" src=""https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/05/not-oabams.jpg"" alt="""" width=""600"" height=""203"" data-recalc-dims=""1"" srcset=""https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/05/not-oabams.jpg?resize=1000%2C338&amp;zoom=1 1000w, https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/05/not-oabams.jpg?resize=1000%2C338&amp;zoom=0.5 500w, https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/05/not-oabams.jpg?resize=1000%2C338&amp;zoom=0.25 250w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"" />
Of course, none of these photographs were taken inside the White House.
Trump shared unfounded anti-Muslim propaganda when he retweeted several photographs from Jayden Fransen, the deputy leader of the reactionary far-right anti-Islam organization Britain First, which has a longstanding problem producing or promulgating factual stories, preying instead on fear and xenophobia:
<img loading=""lazy"" class=""aligncenter wp-image-119983"" style=""border: 1px solid black;"" src=""https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/12/trump-tweets-antimuslim-video.jpg"" alt="""" width=""600"" height=""411"" data-recalc-dims=""1"" srcset=""https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/12/trump-tweets-antimuslim-video.jpg?resize=577%2C395&amp;zoom=1 577w, https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/12/trump-tweets-antimuslim-video.jpg?resize=577%2C395&amp;zoom=0.5 289w, https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/12/trump-tweets-antimuslim-video.jpg?resize=577%2C395&amp;zoom=0.25 144w"" sizes=""(max-width: 577px) 100vw, 577px"" />
This video does not feature a “Muslim migrant.” The teenager in the video was born and raised in the Netherlands (where the video was taken) and his religion was never explicitly stated.
Protests
The turnout at President Trump’s inauguration may not have been the biggest in history, but the women’s march protesting his inauguration may have truly been the largest single-day demonstration in the recorded history of the United States.
Several faked photographs purporting to be from the events were circulated on social media in an apparent attempt to undercut or discredit their messages. One image, for instance, showed actress Whoopi Goldberg wearing a shirt featuring a violent image of President Donald Trump. Another, genuine image from that same event shows that Goldberg was wearing a completely different shirt:
<img loading=""lazy"" class=""aligncenter wp-image-119964"" style=""border: 1px solid black;"" src=""https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/12/whoopi-and-trump.jpg"" alt="""" width=""600"" height=""300"" data-recalc-dims=""1"" srcset=""https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/12/whoopi-and-trump.jpg?resize=1000%2C500&amp;zoom=1 1000w, https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/12/whoopi-and-trump.jpg?resize=1000%2C500&amp;zoom=0.5 500w, https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/12/whoopi-and-trump.jpg?resize=1000%2C500&amp;zoom=0.25 250w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"" />
The Women’s March on Washington, D.C. and its sister demonstrations across the country were huge, but they were not the only protests of 2017. People gathered in cities across the country throughout the year to stage anti-Trump protests, and images from these gatherings were doctored and shared in mocking memes intended to denigrate and humiliate them:
<img loading=""lazy"" class=""aligncenter wp-image-119967"" style=""border: 1px solid black;"" src=""https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/12/refugee-doors.jpg"" alt="""" width=""600"" height=""428"" data-recalc-dims=""1"" srcset=""https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/12/refugee-doors.jpg?resize=768%2C548&amp;zoom=1 768w, https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/12/refugee-doors.jpg?resize=768%2C548&amp;zoom=0.5 384w, https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/12/refugee-doors.jpg?resize=768%2C548&amp;zoom=0.25 192w"" sizes=""(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px"" />
Photographs from these demonstrations were also used in a particularly dark form of propaganda. After the October 2017 mass shooting in Las Vegas that left more than sixty people dead and hundreds more injured, trolls attempted to connect the shooter to a political ideology by sharing photographs of an man (who is completely unrelated to that horrific mass murder) in the so-called “pussyhat” made famous during the women’s marches:
<img loading=""lazy"" class=""aligncenter wp-image-119970"" style=""border: 1px solid black;"" src=""https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/12/paddock-left-wing-violence-1.jpg"" alt="""" width=""600"" height=""515"" data-recalc-dims=""1"" srcset=""https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/12/paddock-left-wing-violence-1.jpg?resize=768%2C659&amp;zoom=1 768w, https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/12/paddock-left-wing-violence-1.jpg?resize=768%2C659&amp;zoom=0.5 384w, https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/12/paddock-left-wing-violence-1.jpg?resize=768%2C659&amp;zoom=0.25 192w"" sizes=""(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px"" />
The same tactic was also used after yet another mass shooting at a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, in which the shooter killed 26 people, including small children, during a service. Opportunistic provocateurs and propaganda peddlers shared photographs of another unrelated person at a Bernie Sanders rally, along with the completely unsubstantiated (and as it turned out, completely untrue) claim that it showed the shooter:

Sexual Assault
Sexual assault and harassment became the dominant topic of conversation beginning in October 2017, after the New York Times reported that Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein had for decades been paying off and intimidating women who accused him of improprieties. In the weeks that followed, dozens of women and men came forward to accuse politicians, filmmakers, journalists, industry leaders, and President Donald Trump of sexual assault, harassment, and intimidation.
As the #MeToo movement took off, some tried to muddy the waters by spreading rumor, innuendo, and, naturally, doctored photographs. A number of fake news outlets published stories with bogus accusations (no, Stephen Hawking was not accused of assault, to name just one example) and countless hoax photographs appeared online.
As several women accused President Trump of sexual assault, it was unsurprising to see fake images of President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden appear alongside claims that the previous administrations were the real perpetrators of abuse and assault:
<img loading=""lazy"" class=""aligncenter wp-image-107205"" style=""border: 1px solid black;"" src=""https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/10/obama-awards.jpg"" alt="""" width=""600"" height=""491"" data-recalc-dims=""1"" srcset=""https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/10/obama-awards.jpg?resize=1190%2C973&amp;zoom=1 1190w, https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/10/obama-awards.jpg?resize=1190%2C973&amp;zoom=0.5 595w, https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/10/obama-awards.jpg?resize=1190%2C973&amp;zoom=0.25 298w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1190px) 100vw, 1190px"" />
These are not real photographs of Obama bestowing the Presidential Medal of Freedom on Harvey Weinstein, Bill Cosby, and Anthony Weiner, although the photograph of former United States President Bill Clinton is real. Bill Cosby was also a Medal of Freedom recipient, but that award was not bestowed by President Obama. Here are the real photographs that these hoaxes were based on:

This is also not a genuine photograph of Joe Biden groping a woman:

Biden’s hands were considerably lower in the original photograph:

The original image, which was taken from a video on President Trump’s inauguration day, showed President Obama’s hand in considerably higher position:

Nazis and Antifa
White supremacy saw an open resurgence in 2017 that was highlighted with a rally in Charlottesville, Virginia that culminated with a neo-Nazi suspect deliberately plowing a car into a crowd, badly injuring several and killing protester Heather Heyer.
When President Trump responded to the incident by famously saying there were “very fine people on both sides,” critics accused him of being a Nazi sympathizer or a white nationalist himself; in order to drive that point home, a number of hoax images purportedly showing Trump and members of his administration in Ku Klux Klan gear were pushed on social media.
This is not Sarah Huckabee Sanders dressed in a Klan robe for Halloween as a child:
<img loading=""lazy"" class=""aligncenter wp-image-107915"" style=""border: 1px solid black;"" src=""https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/10/sarah_huckabee_sanders_kkk_halloween_faux_feature.jpg"" alt="""" width=""600"" height=""314"" data-recalc-dims=""1"" srcset=""https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/10/sarah_huckabee_sanders_kkk_halloween_faux_feature.jpg?resize=1200%2C628&amp;zoom=1 1200w, https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/10/sarah_huckabee_sanders_kkk_halloween_faux_feature.jpg?resize=1200%2C628&amp;zoom=0.5 600w, https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/10/sarah_huckabee_sanders_kkk_halloween_faux_feature.jpg?resize=1200%2C628&amp;zoom=0.25 300w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"" />
This image does not show Trump posing with one of the alt-right members involved in the Charlottesville rally:

A photograph showed a black police officer providing security for a white nationalist gathering is genuine:

The rise of white supremacy in 2017 also led to the proliferation of anti-fascist, or antifa, groups. As a loosely connected network of like-minded individuals with no official leaders or spokespeople but united in their distaste for fascism, they naturally found themselves subjected to a number of hoaxes and disinformation campaigns.
This image, for instance, doesn’t actually show an antifa member beating up a police officer:
<img loading=""lazy"" class=""aligncenter wp-image-100293"" style=""border: 1px solid black;"" src=""https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/08/not-antifa.jpg"" alt="""" width=""600"" height=""693"" data-recalc-dims=""1"" srcset=""https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/08/not-antifa.jpg?resize=534%2C617&amp;zoom=1 534w, https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/08/not-antifa.jpg?resize=534%2C617&amp;zoom=0.5 267w, https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/08/not-antifa.jpg?resize=534%2C617&amp;zoom=0.25 134w"" sizes=""(max-width: 534px) 100vw, 534px"" />
The fake photograph was created by using a genuine 2009 image showing a demonstration in Greece. The “antifa” logo was simply slapped onto the back of this person’s jacket using editing software:
<img loading=""lazy"" class=""aligncenter wp-image-100296"" style=""border: 1px solid black;"" src=""https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/08/antifa-or-greece.jpg"" alt="""" width=""600"" height=""190"" data-recalc-dims=""1"" srcset=""https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/08/antifa-or-greece.jpg?resize=1000%2C316&amp;zoom=1 1000w, https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/08/antifa-or-greece.jpg?resize=1000%2C316&amp;zoom=0.5 500w, https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/08/antifa-or-greece.jpg?resize=1000%2C316&amp;zoom=0.25 250w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"" />
Alt-right propagandists also circulated fake material in attempts to discredit the groups, such as this fake flyer and manual:

Solar Eclipse
On 21 August 2017, thousands of people gathered along the path of totality to witness the first solar eclipse to make its way across over the contiguous United States since 1918, spawning stunning images — some of which were completely fake, such as this image of a setting solar eclipse:

This is not an actual photograph of the eclipse from space:

Sunlight during the eclipse did not arrange itself into the shape of a cross:

One of the most popular images of the 2017 solar eclipse is actually completely real, however. Despite repeated warnings not to look directly at the solar eclipse, President Donald Trump did, for a moment, look at the event without his protective glasses:

Hurricanes, Tornadoes, and Sharks,,,,,,,
It is almost inevitable for hoaxes to circulate in the wakes of major storms or natural disasters, so when a series of huge, historically destructive hurricanes made landfall in 2017, it wasn’t surprising to see a new batch of manipulated images tear their own swaths across social media.,,,,,,
This is not an actual photograph of a massive wave striking Jennette’s Pier in North Carolina:,,,,,,,,,

The 2017 hurricane season also saw an unusually large number of fake sharks, appearing in rumors that Hurricane Irma had turned into a real-life Sharknado and that an especially large (and infinitely repurposed) specimen was roaming down the highway in Houston.,,,,,,,,
Our favorite piece of fake shark media, however, came shortly after Hurricane Irma flooded portions of Miami:,,,,,,,

This video was not created with the use of digital editing software, but was instead done the old-fashioned way, with a combination of practical effects and ridiculous novelty gifts:,,,,,,,

President Donald Trump also made appearances in hurricane relief and recovery with a series of hoax photographs purported to show the president personally giving assistance in affected areas.,,,,,,,,,
For example, Trump was not spotted rescuing two cats from floods:,,,,,,,,

						Are the Spires on Disney World’s Cinderella Castle Removable in Case of Hurricane?","Cinderella Castle in Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida was constructed such that it can be partially or wholly disassembled in the event of a hurricane.","False
					
						
							About this rating","While Florida was ramping up preparations for the arrival of devastating Hurricane Irma in early September 2017, a rumor spread that construction crews at Walt Disney World in Orlando were hard at work detaching the spires from the Magic Kingdom’s most iconic structure, Cinderella Castle, to prevent storm damage.
It was strange because it seemed to confirm a decades-old, long-since-debunked urban legend that the Cinderella Castle was designed and built such that all or part of it can be quickly “dismantled” in the event of an approaching hurricane. Disney officials say that isn’t true.
When the web site of the British newspaper The Guardian reported that Walt Disney World would close its doors on 10 September 2017 in advance of Hurricane Irma, the article included an embedded tweet noting that Cinderella Castle’s spires were being removed to spare them from the storm, complete with an alleged photo of the project:

— Lori Miggins (@lorimiggins) September 8, 2017


The tweet turned up on several other web sites as well, including that of the Alabama Media Group (AL.com), where it was used in a 9 September report on how various Florida theme parks were preparing for the hurricane. None of the web sites questioned the legitimacy of the claim, though they should have. The original tweet, dated 5 September 2017, was an admitted prank.
	
		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
It issued from the Twitter account of WDW Kingdomcast, which is also the name of an irreverent podcast about the goings-on at Walt Disney World. The same claim was posted on the podcast’s Facebook page. Buried among the 1,000-plus comments on that post was the following post hoc disclaimer stating that the announcement had been a gag based on “a very common myth”:
<img loading=""lazy"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-105355"" style=""border: 1px solid black;"" src=""https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/09/wdw.jpg"" alt="""" width=""600"" height=""180"" data-recalc-dims=""1"" srcset=""https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/09/wdw.jpg?resize=600%2C180&amp;zoom=1 600w, https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/09/wdw.jpg?resize=600%2C180&amp;zoom=0.5 300w, https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/09/wdw.jpg?resize=600%2C180&amp;zoom=0.25 150w"" sizes=""(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"" />

We traced the photo of the crane supposedly detaching Cinderella Castle’s spires to a February 2016 blog post documenting the removal of Christmas lights. 
It is indeed an exceptionally common myth that part or all of Cinderella Castle is removable or dismantlable in an emergency. In 2010, it was listed by Time as one of the top five most popular urban legends about Disney World. Going back further, we find it mentioned and debunked in a 1997 Chicago Tribune article on the “secrets” of the Magic Kingdom:
Ever hear the legend that Cinderella Castle can be dismantled in the event of an approaching hurricane? That’s not only a tale, it’s a fairy tale. According to imagineers involved in its construction, Cinderella Castle was built to code to withstand hurricane-force winds and can in no way be disassembled.
Describing the construction of the castle (which was still underway) in 1970, the Orlando Sentinel reported that more than 600 tons of steel are embedded in the concrete walls, turrets, and spires of the 189-foot-tall structure, which sits on a 100-by-100-foot concrete foundation. It has survived several hurricanes during the 45-plus years of Disney World’s existence, including at least two major storms strong enough to require the park to be closed.
Photographs exist of the turrets and 40-foot-tall spires being hoisted into place toward the end of the construction process, a procedure which may have provided the inspiration for the notion that they are removable. Disney historian Jim Korkis writes in Secret Stories of Walt Disney World: Things You Never Knew You Never Knew:
One Disney “urban myth” is that in the event of a hurricane, the castle can be dismantled. That is untrue. The main building has an internal grid of steel framing, secured to a concrete foundation. The turrets and towers also have internal steel framing and were lifted by crane, then bolted permanently to the main structure. Since people saw the castle being assembled in two separate sections, they assumed it could also be dismantled that way as well. The castle can withstand hurricane winds of at least 90 miles per hour.
We found a couple interesting variants of the legend while searching through old issues of the Orlando Sentinel, including this one a reporter culled from the early internet in 1995:
A discussion about Cinderella’s Castle, which several people said could be quickly dismantled if a major hurricane were headed its way. One said it could be torn down in 20 minutes; another said it had been done several times as part of a drill. The story gets better with each file — until a Disney employee breaks in to say basically that there’s no more validity to the porta-castle story than the one about Walt being frozen.
And in this, our favorite version, also recounted in 1995 (in the aftermath of Hurricane Erin), the legend devolves into a pure flight of fantasy:
Much to the surprise of a reporter from an international news organization, Magic Kingdom officials did not — and cannot — lower Cinderella’s Castle into the ground when a major storm is approaching. Disney officials, however, would neither confirm nor deny reports that in case of an emergency Epcot’s Spaceship Earth can be deflated like a beach ball."

						Red Cross Instructed to Throw Away Donated Supplies in Texas?","In the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey, the Red Cross was instructed to throw away a significant quantity of supplies that had been donated by the public.","Unproven
					
						
							About this rating","On 10 September 2017, a now-viral video posted to Facebook by Wendy Wilkerson Underwood contained claims that the Red Cross in Houston, Texas was instructed to throw out a significant quantity of food and supplies donated by the public in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey: 
Have you seen the posts about the Red Cross and their abuse of volunteers and evacuees? Well, this is going to blow you away! They are throwing supplies into the trash in Houston. But don’t worry, they said they can collect more from what’s going on in Florida. I’m glad they are so respectful of their donors hard earned money.

In the video, the camera pans over a pile of food, bags, and crates in what appears to be a garage, while the woman narrating it reiterates that it consisted of donations to the organization that had been discarded. No additional information is given. According to the person who narrated the video, the director of the Red Cross in Houston said this was done “because they can get more for Florida.” The narrator also says that that the items shown in the video include 600 brand new, donated blankets and 500 pounds of dog food.
But Red Cross spokesperson Elizabeth Penniman denied in a statement that any such order had been given:
We work with a large number of partners, who provide bulk donations of goods to the Red Cross. There has been no directive given at any of our operations to discard or dispose of any new donated items such as canned food, water, diapers, blankets or dog food.
	
		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
Penniman added that the organization had attempted to contact Underwood:
Numerous inquiries to Ms. Underwood, who originally posted this video, have gone unanswered. These inquiries have come from both the local Red Cross staff on the ground in Texas, the Disaster Response Operation in Texas, and from Red Cross National Headquarters in Washington, DC. It is important to note that these videos seem to have been filmed in Ms. Underwood’s garage in Waco, Texas, nearly 200 miles — or a three-hour drive — from our primary warehousing operations in Houston. We have asked Ms. Underwood if she was on the ground at any one of our Red Cross shelters or warehousing facilities; we have asked her to open these closed plastic bags to show us what is in them, and we have asked her to identify the “Red Cross Director” she cites. She has not done so.
The Red Cross also released a lengthy statement about the matter (although without directly addressing these specific claims):

The Dangers of Rumors and Misinformation
Today there are roughly 6,000 American Red Cross volunteers on the ground in 13 states and U.S. territories whose sole purpose is to help their neighbors. These 6,000 volunteers are helping thousands they’ve never met, who have been devastated by Hurricanes Irma and Harvey, as well as thousands more threatened by wildfires across the West and Northwest. In too many cases to count, our volunteers have set aside family and professional obligations to put our humanitarian mission first and lend a hand.
While these volunteers work tirelessly to deliver much-needed aid to areas decimated by unprecedented disaster events, the American Red Cross is faced with an onslaught of baseless claims, rumors or outright lies that do nothing more than undermine our critical relief efforts.
On this page, we embrace the exchange of different ideas and points of view. And during times of disaster, we know that emotions run high and misinformation is quick to spread. But these accusations (theft, charging for services, denying assistance) not only derail the efforts of so many workers providing aid, they divert resources away from our core mission: to deliver relief. The countless hours spent addressing malicious falsehoods ultimately risk hurting those we’re trying to serve.
So for those of you who doubt our credibility, we have one thing to say to you: Join us. Sign up. Put on a Red Cross vest and volunteer at one of our shelters, blood drives or events. We welcome your service.
For those with complaints, provide specifics so that we may follow up to ensure our services are adequately meeting needs and measuring up to the standards we expect and communities deserve. We take legitimate criticisms seriously.
But for those of you determined to perpetuate hatred, rumors, misinformation or lies, you’ll have to excuse us for not addressing you, as we’ve got important work to do to provide help to those in need.
The organization does sometimes discard items that have been donated, but there is no evidence that it does so indiscriminately or on a large scale, and it only throws out supplies that are unusable for one reason or another, according to Penniman:
With donations of food — whether for those in our shelters, or for pets that might be sheltering with their owners, we have policies and procedures in place to protect the health for all concerned. Very often, we receive an overwhelming amount of donated food to our disaster operations, as well as donations of pet food. As we cannot ensure the safety of food prepared in non-commercial settings, we do not accept home-cooked food as donations. In the case of donated pet food, we cannot accept opened bags of food. Even properly prepared food, if not clearly monitored or packaged, can quickly go bad through no fault of those who prepared or are serving it.		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
While it remains unclear whether these were actually discarded donations or just a pile of somebody’s storm-damaged possessions in a garage, a 2016 CBS report highlights the fact that many well-intentioned charitable contributions are of no use to disaster relief efforts and are often thrown away as a result:


However, the Red Cross has come under scrutiny in the past for alleged mismanagement of donations and funds. Investigative news outlet ProPublica has a whole series on the nonprofit organization and how it has spent its money after disasters."

This content is shared here because the topic may interest Snopes readers; it does not, however, represent the work of Snopes fact-checkers or editors.","HOLLYWOOD, Fla. (AP) — Six patients at a sweltering Hollywood nursing home died in Hurricane Irma’s aftermath, authorities said Wednesday, as people confronted a multitude of new hazards in the storm’s wake, including tree-clearing accidents and lethal fumes from generators.
Hollywood Police Chief Tom Sanchez said investigators believe the deaths at the Rehabilitation Center at Hollywood Hills were heat-related, and added: “The building has been sealed off and we are conducting a criminal investigation.” He did not elaborate.
Three patients were found dead at the nursing home early Wednesday, and three more died at the hospital after more than 100 in all were evacuated, many on stretchers or in wheelchairs, authorities said.
The air conditioning was out, but Sanchez said it remained under investigation whether power was entirely cut. He didn’t answer questions regarding whether a generator was running inside the place.
Also in the Miami area, a Coral Gables apartment building was evacuated after authorities determined a lack of power made it unsafe for elderly tenants, while officers arrived at the huge Century Village retirement community in Pembroke Pines to help people on upper floors without access to working elevators. More than half the community of 15,000 residents lacked power.
	
		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
In addition, at least five people died and more than a dozen were treated after breathing carbon monoxide fumes from generators in the Orlando, Miami and Daytona Beach areas.
Not counting the nursing home deaths, at least 13 people in Florida have died under in Irma-related circumstances, many of them well after the storm had passed. A Tampa man died after the chain saw he was using to remove trees kicked back and cut his carotid artery.
Elsewhere, Irma has been blamed for four deaths in South Carolina and two in Georgia. At least 37 people were killed in the Caribbean.
In the battered Florida Keys, meanwhile, county officials pushed back against a preliminary estimate from the Federal Emergency Management Agency that 25 percent of all homes in the Keys were destroyed and nearly all the rest were heavily damaged.
“Things look real damaged from the air, but when you clear the trees and all the debris, it’s not much damage to the houses,” said Monroe County Commissioner Heather Carruthers.
The Keys felt Irma’s full fury when the hurricane roared in on Sunday with 130 mph (209 kph) winds. But the extent of the damage has been an unanswered question for days because some places have been unreachable.
In Marathon Key, a Publix grocery store opened under police guard on Tuesday, but residents could buy only 20 items each, and no cigarettes or alcohol allowed, said 70-year-old retiree Elaine Yaquinto.
She said she had yet to see any state or federal agencies or utility companies working on the ground yet. Her home had no electricity or running water, apart from a trickle of cold water that was good enough for a shower.		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
“It made me feel like normal,” she said.
President Donald Trump’s homeland security adviser, Tom Bossert, said the federal government is working to help Florida Keys residents secure shelter through rental assistance, hotels or pre-manufactured housing. Trump plans to visit Florida on Thursday.
For many of Irma’s victims, the days ahead are likely to be soggy, sweaty, dark and discouraging. One of the biggest worries is the fate of Florida’s many senior citizens.
The longtime retirement destination has the highest proportion of people 65 and older of any state — 1 in 5 of its 20 million residents.
On Tuesday, Florida Gov. Rick Scott said he had received a lot of calls from nursing homes and assisted living facilities having problems with power.
“We’re doing everything we can to help them get either generators, fuel, power back on. It’s one of the things we’re doing aggressively,” Scott said.
At the Hollywood nursing home, Jean Lindor, a kitchen worker, said through a Haitian Creole translator that the air conditioner had not been working since the storm and it had been hot inside.
Paulburn Bogle, a member of the housekeeping staff, said the place had been hot but manageable the past few days. The staff used fans, put cold towels and ice on patients and gave them cold drinks, he said.		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
Broward County Medical Examiner Dr. Craig Mallak said his office had received the bodies of three of the victims — two women age 71 and another who was 78 — for autopsies.
“They were sick already. It’s going to be tough to tell how much was the heat and how much of it was they were sick already,” Mallak said.
The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which regulates nursing homes, gives Hollywood center a below-average rating, two stars on its five-star scale. But the most recent state inspection reports showed no deficiencies in the area of emergency plans.
Flora Mitchell arrived at the home trying to find out what happened to her 58-year-old sister, Vonda Wilson, a stroke patient who lived there for about 10 years. She said she last heard from her sister two days ago and found out the air conditioning was not working.
“We need to know what happened to her,” she said. “They haven’t told us anything.”
Calls to the owner and other officials at the home were not immediately returned. The facility was bought at a bankruptcy auction two years ago after its previous owner when to prison for Medicare fraud, according to news reports at the time of the sale.
At the Coral Gables building that was evacuated, five firefighters went up the dark emergency stairwell, strapped Ofelia Carrillo — a frail 97-year-old woman who is immobile and has heart problems — to a special evacuation chair and carried her down.
“This is the most stressful situation I’ve lived in my life,” said her daughter Madeleine Alvarez said.		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
The number of people without electricity in the steamy late-summer heat dropped to 9.5 million — just under half of Florida’s population. Utility officials warned it could take 10 days or more for power to be fully restored. About 110,000 people remained in shelters across the state.
While nearly all of Florida was engulfed by the massive storm, the Keys — home to about 70,000 people — appeared to be the hardest hit. Drinking water and power were cut off, all three of the islands’ hospitals were closed, and gasoline was extremely limited.
Search-and-rescue teams made their way into the more distant reaches of the Keys, and an aircraft carrier was positioned off Key West to help. Officials said it was not known how many people ignored evacuation orders and stayed behind in the Keys, but a county spokeswoman said Wednesday that crews had so far found no casualties in their door-to-door searches of the hardest-hit areas.
Crews also worked to repair two washed-out, 300-foot (90-meter) sections of U.S. 1, the sole highway that runs through the Keys, and check the safety of the 42 bridges linking the islands.
The Lower Keys, including the most populous island, Key West, were still off-limits, with a roadblock in place where the highway was washed out.

						Did Jennifer Lawrence Say Hurricanes Are ‘Nature’s Wrath’ Against Trump?",Actress Jennifer Lawrence blamed recent hurricanes in the U.S. on President Trump.,"False
					
						
							About this rating","In September 2017, right-wing websites accused actress Jennifer Lawrence of blaming President Trump for the deadly hurricanes that recently ravaged several Caribbean nations along with Texas and Florida.
Newsbusters, for example, reported that Lawrence said “‘Mother Nature’s Rage’ Directed at U.S. Because of Trump.” Two days later, Fox News host Tucker Carlson dedicated a segment to Lawrence’s purported comments with an accompanying online article headline that reads, “Tucker Slams ‘Out of Touch’ Jennifer Lawrence for Linking Hurricanes to Trump.” In the segment, Carlson and his guest poke fun at Lawrence for suffering from what they call “Trump Derangement Syndrome.”
The false rumor is a twisted version of comments that Lawrence made during an interview on British television to promote her new movie Mother!, a psychological thriller that uses climate change as a central metaphor. 
During the interview, Lawrence said science has demonstrated that climate change is the result of human activity. When prompted by the interviewer, she added that she was troubled by the 2016 presidential election results. She never mentioned President Trump by name in that interview, but within hours various publications were sensationalizing it with commentary claiming the actress blamed him for hurricanes Harvey and Irma, which struck southeast Texas and Florida in late August and early September.
It didn’t take long for the rumor to spread to more traditionally mainstream publications like the New York Daily News and celebrity site Us Weekly, which put the false claim in their headlines. The British publication The Independent further took liberties with the actress’s comments by reporting, inaccurately:
Jennifer Lawrence has suggested that it is difficult not to feel as though the devastating hurricanes in Texas and approaching Florida are signs of “Mother Nature’s rage and wrath” at America for electing Donald Trump.
	
		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
The Independent story has an even more misleading headline if one sees it in a Google search result:

Here is a transcript of the actual exchange:
Long: When the director was asked about the film, why it was so dark, he said, “It’s a mad time to be alive.” And there’s certainly a sort of end-of-days feeling about it. For many people in America who would say perhaps it’s true there at the moment than anywhere else. I mean what are your thoughts about the changes that have happened in your own country over the last year or so?
Lawrence: It’s scary, you know, it’s this new language that’s forming. I don’t even recognize it. It’s also scary to know — it’s been proven through science that human activity — that climate change is due to human activity and we continue to ignore it and the only voice that we really have is through voting. Um, so —
Long: And you have voted —
Lawrence: And we voted, and it was really startling. You know, you’re watching these hurricanes now, and it’s really — it’s hard, especially while promoting this movie not to feel Mother Nature’s rage, or wrath.
On 10 September 2017, Lawrence herself responded to the controversy on her official Facebook page, writing:
My remarks were taken grossly out of context. Obviously I never claimed that President Trump was responsible for these tragic hurricanes. That is a silly and preposterous headline that is unfortunate, because it detracts from the millions of lives that are being impacted by these devastating storms and the recent earthquake. What is really important is focusing on the ways we can help. My heart is with everyone affected and the brave first responders who are working to keep us all safe. Please join me in donating to:

During the interview, Lawrence did express sadness in the failure to adequately address climate change and environmental degradation and said that the power to do so comes from Americans’ ability to vote for their elected leaders.
President Trump has been on the record denying climate change and has selected fellow climate change deniers to head key agencies such as the EPA and NASA. However, although Lawrence has made it no secret she is not a supporter of the president, she didn’t blame him for the recent hurricanes."

						Did Ilhan Omar Hold ‘Secret Fundraisers’ with ‘Islamic Groups Tied to Terror’?","Minnesota Democrat Ilhan Omar held ""secret fundraisers"" with ""Islamic groups tied to terror.""","False
					
						
							About this rating","On 22 March 2019, the Washington Free Beacon website accused U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minnesota) of “holding a series of secret fundraisers with groups that have been tied to the support of terrorism, appearances that have been closed to the press and hidden from public view.”
Although it’s true that Omar in February and March of 2019 attended two fundraising events that were not open to the news media (one for charity and one for her reelection campaign), the events were not secret, nor were they hosted by groups “tied to terror.” Furthermore, a third event in which she spoke in front of a large crowd in Los Angeles on 23 March 2019 could hardly be mistaken for a “secret” one, as it was livestreamed by Fox News. Those facts didn’t stop an echo chamber of websites from reproducing similar headlines insinuating that a U.S. congresswoman was sneaking around holding furtive meetings with global terror-linked organizations.
Omar is one of the first two Muslim women to serve in Congress. An immigrant from Somalia, she is also the only member of Congress to don a hijab, the head covering worn by observant Muslim women. She has been the target of a slew of hoaxes and conspiracy theories, including unfounded claims she married her brother to game the U.S. immigration system, and false claims she made incendiary comments about white men. This fundraiser rumor is also not the first instance in which she has been falsely linked to terrorism.
Free Beacon reported that, “Omar recently spoke in Florida at a private event hosted by Islamic Relief, a charity organization long said to have deep ties to groups that advocate terrorism against Israel. Over the weekend, she will appear at another private event in California that is hosted by CAIR-CA PAC, a political action committee affiliated with the Council on American Islamic Relations, or CAIR a group that was named as an unindicted co-conspirator in a massive terror-funding incident.”
Those two sentences contained numerous falsehoods. For starters, Free Beacon conflated different organizations with similar names and relied on unreliable accusations or incomplete context to support their “terror ties” claim.
	
		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
The event in Florida was hosted by Islamic Relief USA (IRUSA). Although IRUSA licenses the “Islamic Relief” name from the global umbrella organization Islamic Relief Worldwide (IRW), it is distinct from IRW. IRUSA is a Virginia-based, non-profit that operates in 40 countries to provide disaster relief and to fight societal ills such as poverty, hunger, and inequality. It is also one of the organizations that has participated in the U.S. government’s Combined Federal Campaign, one of many charities that federal employees can select to donate to directly from their paychecks.
It was clear that Free Beacon conflated these two organizations, reporting that “Islamic Relief has come under congressional investigation for what lawmakers have described as its efforts to provide assistance to terrorist group such as Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood. The charity has been banned by some countries as a result of these ties. In 2017, Congress sought to ban taxpayer funds from reaching the charity due to these terror links.”
All the references linked to by Free Beacon are about IRW and not IRUSA, even though Omar spoke at IRUSA’s 23 February 2019 benefit dinner to help raise money for famine victims in Yemen. It’s unclear how the IRUSA event attended by Omar could be construed as “secret,” because although it was not open to the news media, the Eventbite page advertising the event noted that members of the public could RSVP to attend for as little as $15.
And although it’s true that then-U.S. Rep. Ron DeSantis (R-Florida) had pushed for an amendment to a spending bill that would have eliminated State Department funding for IRW, it died when DeSantis was not present to offer the amendment for a vote, citing the looming threat of Hurricane Irma. Opponents of the bill, including then-U.S. Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minnesota), argued the amendment was motivated by Islamophobia, noting that IRW had broad support from reputable relief organizations and a track record of working alongside various United Nations agencies and European governments.
United Kingdom-based IRW was banned from operating in the United Arab Emirates and Israel over terror accusations by the governments of those countries, which the charity forcefully denied. (The British newspaper The Telegraph termed the charges “ludicrous and defamatory.”) Furthermore, the U.S. government does not designate the Muslim Brotherhood, which is an international religious and political movement, as a terrorist organization.
Free Beacon demonstrated a similar problem conflating the prominent civil rights, non-profit organization Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) with a separate political action committee, CAIR California PAC (CAIR PAC CA).
On 24 March 2019, Omar spoke to an audience at a banquet hosted by CAIR’s Los Angeles chapter. The event was attended by an estimated 1,000 protesters, who demonstrated outside the Hilton Woodland Hills venue as Omar spoke. The event garnered widespread coverage from news media.
CAIR-Los Angeles Executive Director Hussam Ayloush expressed frustration about the characterization of the organization’s activities as “secret” or “terror”-related, telling us that they were unfair. “For Islamophobes, anything that Muslims do is nefarious somehow. When Muslims don’t engage [in American politics and discourse] they say, ‘Oh what’s wrong with them, they’re not integrating. They must have secret plans.’ And when we are engaging they ask, ‘Why are they engaging, they must have secret plans.'”		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
The day following the Woodland Hills event, Omar spoke at a privately hosted political fundraiser in Irvine, California, to benefit her reelection campaign. That event was sponsored by CAIR PAC CA, a political action committee that supports candidates of its choosing. According to fliers advertising the fundraiser, the event was billed as a “meet and greet” with Omar. The public could RSVP to attend by donating anywhere from $50 to $250, upon which the address of the venue would be provided.
Citing death threats directed at Omar and the recent suspected hate crime vandalism of an Escondido, California, mosque, CAIR PAC CA President Joe Salas told us the event’s address was kept discreet out of fear for the congresswoman’s safety. But the event itself wasn’t “secret,” he said, and about 400 to 500 people attended.
“We will open our events to the public when President Trump opens his [events] down at Mar-a-Lago,” Salas joked, referencing similarly discreet campaign fundraising events that have benefited President Donald Trump.
Accusations that CAIR has links to terrorism are long-standing, as are CAIR’s rebuttals that the effort to paint them as such stems from anti-Muslim bigotry. The New York Times documented in 2007 that:
Broadly summarized, critics accuse CAIR of pursuing an extreme Islamist political agenda and say at least five figures with ties to the group or its leadership have either been convicted or deported for links to terrorist groups. They include Mousa Abu Marzook, a Hamas leader deported in 1997 after the United States failed to produce any evidence directly linking him to any attacks.
There were no charges linked to CAIR in any of the cases involved, and law enforcement officials said that in the current climate, any hint of suspicious behavior would have resulted in a racketeering charge.
The Times also quoted retired FBI counter-terrorism agent Michael Rolince as stating, “Of all the groups, there is probably more suspicion about CAIR, but when you ask people for cold hard facts, you get blank stares.”
Documenting a similar controversy in 2006 in which CAIR was accused of having terror links, the Associated Press reported:
In a fundraising letter, state GOP Chairman Ron Carey said [Keith] Ellison has received “financial support from a self-identified supporter of Hamas.”
That was a reference to [CAIR founder Nihad] Awad’s 1994 statement that he preferred Hamas to the Palestinian Liberation Organization. In an interview, Awad said that was before the group engaged in suicide bombings and was designated a terrorist organization by the State Department.
“I don’t support Hamas today,” Awad said. “My position and CAIR’s position is extremely clear — we condemn suicide bombings. We are mainstream American Muslims.”		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
The claim that CAIR was an “un-indicted co-conspirator” in a terror plot is incomplete and not new. The Washington Post analyzed it in 2011, reporting:
These claims lack context. CAIR is an aggressive Muslim civil liberties organization, modeled on the Anti Defamation League, that has made it a target for criticism. It was indeed named as an “unindicted co-conspirator or joint venturer” in the Holy Land Foundation case — an Islamic charity that in 2008 was convicted of funding Islamic militant groups. But CAIR was not alone in that designation; nearly 250 other organizations and individuals were also named.
The federal government said the organizations were included on the list in order to produce evidence at the trial, but the district court and a federal appeals court later ruled that it had been a mistake to make the list public.
As the appeals court summed up last year, “The court held that the Government did not argue or establish any legitimate government interest that warranted publicly identifying [one of the organizations] and 245 other individuals and entities as unindicted co-conspirators or joint venturers, and that the Government had less injurious means than those employed, such as anonymously designating the unindicted co-conspirators as ‘other persons,’ asking the court to file the document under seal, or disclosing the information to the defendants pursuant to a protective order.”
However, federal Judge Jorge A. Solis denied CAIR’s request that its name be publicly stricken from the list. He said that the government “has produced ample evidence” to establish the association of CAIR and other organizations with entities such as the Holy Land Foundation, the Islamic Association for Palestine and with the Hamas militant group. Solis acknowledged CAIR’s claim that evidence produced by the government “largely predates” the official designation of these groups as terror organizations but he said the “evidence is nonetheless sufficient to show the association of these entities with HLF, IAP, and Hamas.”
Free Beacon reported that “Omar’s appearance at these closed-door forums is raising eyebrows in the pro-Israel world due to her repeated and unapologetic public use of anti-Semitic stereotypes accusing Jewish people of controlling foreign policy and politics. With Omar’s popularity skyrocketing on the anti-Israel left, it appears her rhetoric is translating into fundraising prowess.”
Estee Chandler, founder of the Los Angeles chapter of the progressive organization Jewish Voice for Peace (JVP), dismissed claims that Omar’s commentary represents anti-Semitic views. Chandler, who supports Omar and maintains her comments were directed at state policy and not the Jewish people, accepted an award on behalf of JVP’s work at the Irvine event at which Omar spoke.
“My rebuttal is that when they announced we were getting this award, Jewish Voice for Peace got a fairly long standing ovation from this room of supposed anti-Semites,” she told us. “It defies logic that anyone could characterize that room as anti-Semitic.”
Salas said that Omar’s talk at the PAC event in Irvine wasn’t recorded, but that it didn’t contain any anti-Semitic remarks. Instead, he said, most of the crowd was composed of young activists who asked Omar a lot of biographical questions about her road to Congress. Also in attendance were members of San Diego, California’s, Somali population and some members of the Jewish community, he said.
We reached out to Free Beacon with emailed questions about their story but the publication declined to answer them."

							About this rating","A host of rumors concerning the American Red Cross and their disaster relief efforts cropped up in September 2017 after a string of hurricanes battered the United States. Among them was a photograph that purportedly showed a meal served by the nonprofit organization in Texas after Hurricane Harvey:

The pictured meal, consisting of some slices of ham and cheese, crackers, and cauliflower, actually shows a school lunch that was served to a student in Chickasha, Oklahoma, in 2014:
Angry parents in Chickasha complain their kids aren’t getting enough to eat at school. The Holton family says the meal the district calls a “Munchable” is ridiculous and family members say it needs to change.
The meal that daughter Kaytlin Shelton took a photo of consists of lunch meat, a couple crackers, a slice of cheese and two pieces of cauliflower. Schools in Chickasha serve it every other week.
Kelly Tyco, a reporter for the newspaper TC Palm, posted a picture of a  real meal served by the Red Cross at a shelter at Hidden Oaks Middle School in Florida after Hurricane Irma. That meal included a hamburger, french fries, and fresh fruit and vegetables:

	
		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		

A controversy over portion sizes did arise in September 2016 when the Red Cross provided meals to victims of severe flooding in Louisiana and some meal recipients posted photographs apparently showing disturbingly meager offerings:

However, the scanty portions were not representative of all Red Cross meals served during that disaster,   as we reported at the time
The Red Cross acknowledged that some food boxes went out with ridiculously small portions: the result of an error, [Red Cross spokesman Jay] Bonafede said, which was subsequently corrected. The user who posted the chicken nuggets and peas photograph said he received an apology from the organization.
The Red Cross was also subjected to rumors holding that they were charging victims for their services (false), that they refused to serve hamburgers (mixture), and that they threw away hundreds of pounds of donations (unproven). In response, the nonprofit published a post on Facebook about the dangers of rumors and misinformation:"

This content is shared here because the topic may interest Snopes readers; it does not, however, represent the work of Snopes fact-checkers or editors.","FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) — As Hurricane Irma bears down on Florida, an Associated Press analysis shows a steep drop in flood insurance across the state, including the areas most endangered by what could be a devastating storm surge.
In just five years, the state’s total number of federal flood insurance policies has fallen by 15 percent, according to Federal Emergency Management Agency data.
Florida’s property owners still buy far more federal flood insurance than any other state — 1.7 million policies, covering about $42 billion in assets — but most residents in hazard zones are badly exposed.
With 1,350 miles of coastline, the most in the continental United States, Florida has roughly 2.5 million homes in hazard zones, more than three times that of any other state, FEMA estimates. And yet, across Florida’s 38 coastal counties, just 42 percent of these homes are covered.
Florida’s overall flood insurance rate for hazard-zone homes is just 41 percent. Fannie Mae ostensibly requires mortgage lenders to make sure property owners buy this insurance to qualify for federally backed loans, and yet in 59 percent of the cases, that insurance isn’t being paid for.
	
		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
In the counties being under at least partial evacuation orders Wednesday (Collier, Broward, Monroe and Miami-Dade), where 1.3 million houses are estimated to be in flood hazard zones, the percentage is an even lower 34.3 percent.
Nationwide, only half the 10 million properties that need flood insurance have it, said Roy Wright, who runs the National Flood Insurance Program. He told the AP last week that he wants to double the number of policies sold nationally in the near future.
The declines in coverage started after Congress approved a price hike in 2012, making policies more expensive. Maps of some high-risk areas were redrawn, removing a requirement that these homeowners get the insurance. About 7 of 10 homeowners have federally backed mortgages, and if they live in a high-risk area, they still are required to have flood insurance. But many let their policies slip without the lender noticing; loans also get sold and repackaged, paperwork gets lost and new lenders don’t follow up.
FEMA, which is ultimately responsible for enforcing flood insurance requirements, did not respond to an email seeking comment from its Washington office on Wednesday.
The latest forecasts suggest Irma’s most destructive winds could carve up much of Florida’s priciest real estate, damaging properties from the Florida Keys through Jacksonville as it swirls north.
“This could easily be the most costly storm in U.S. history, which is saying a lot considering what just happened two weeks ago,” said University of Miami hurricane researcher Brian McNoldy.
Insurance companies are still tallying the damage from Hurricane Harvey’s extended stay over southern Texas in August, but insured losses are estimated at $20 billion, and that’s a fraction of the $65 billion or more in losses due to flooding alone that could have been insured, according to the catastrophe modeling firm AIR Worldwide.
No one is expecting Irma to flood Florida on a similar scale. Harvey sat over Houston for days, dumping up to 50 inches of rain. Irma is moving swiftly and should bring less than a quarter of that to Florida cities.		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
South Florida also has a better flood control system, the ground is more porous and there aren’t any hills to send water rushing down from above, said Hugh Willoughby, a former research director at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and now a professor at Florida International University in Miami.
Still, many Floridians could find themselves with no money for flood repairs, just like people in Houston, where flood coverage dropped by 9 percent since 2012.
If Irma’s eye follows a track just west of Florida’s eastern coast, the initial storm surge could heavily damage the Florida Keys, the cities at the southern tip of Florida’s mainland, Florida City and Homestead, parts of Miami and Miami Beach, and other Atlantic coast cities, said Brian Haus, a professor of ocean sciences at the University of Miami’s Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science.
The AP analysis shows that the number of flood insurance policies sold in the Keys, Miami, Miami Beach and Homestead has stayed basically steady since 2012, but tiny Florida City has seen a drop of 31 percent. Miami-Dade County overall has seen a 7 percent drop in policies sold, falling from 371,000 in 2012 to 342,000 today.
Just to the north in Broward County, home to Fort Lauderdale, the state has seen its biggest drop among major counties, falling 44 percent from 372,000 policies five years ago to 207,000 today. County officials say they don’t track the flood insurance program, leaving that to the cities.
If Irma’s eye moves instead up Florida’s west coast, that would put Tampa, St. Petersburg and other Gulf cities in danger to significant storm surge, Haus said. St. Petersburg has seen an almost 10 percent drop in federal flood policies written in the last five years, while Tampa has seen a 3.5 percent drop, according to the AP analysis.

							About this rating","In September 2017, as the Caribbean and southeastern United States geared up for monster storm Irma, the Pizza Hut restaurant chain came under criticism when a picture circulated online of employee directives.
The note reportedly originated in a Jacksonville, Florida restaurant, asking workers — referenced here as TMs, short for team members — to make sure they “are ready NOW” and to inform regional general managers (or RGMs for short) if they planned to evacuate because of the storm:
<img loading=""lazy"" class=""size-full wp-image-103449 aligncenter"" style=""border: 1px solid black;"" src=""https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/09/Pizza-Hut-note-to-FL-workers.jpg"" alt="""" width=""600"" height=""837"" data-recalc-dims=""1"" srcset=""https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/09/Pizza-Hut-note-to-FL-workers.jpg?resize=600%2C837&amp;zoom=1 600w, https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/09/Pizza-Hut-note-to-FL-workers.jpg?resize=600%2C837&amp;zoom=0.5 300w, https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/09/Pizza-Hut-note-to-FL-workers.jpg?resize=600%2C837&amp;zoom=0.25 150w"" sizes=""(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"" />
However, the note also informed workers:


If evacuating, you will have a 24-hour period before storm “grace period” to not be scheduled. You cannot evacuate Friday for a Tuesday storm event!
Failure to show for these shifts, regardless of reason, will be considered a no call/no show and documentation will be issued.
Expectation is that all TM’s work their schedule until store related storm closure (unless evacuating), then a 24 hour period will be given.
Again, failure to show for these shifts, regardless of reason, will be considered a no call/no show and documentation will be issued.
In the event of an evacuation, you MUST return within 72 hours.


	
		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
Pizza Hut spokesperson Doug Terfehr confirmed the note’s existence to us on 11 September 2017, but added that it was created by a manager at a franchise-owned location, rather than one owned by the company. The unidentified manager, he said, “elected to add a few things on their own” to a set of recommendations Pizza Hut provided to franchise locations.
The company also released a statement:
We are uncompromising in our commitment to the safety and well-being of our team members. All locations in the path of Irma are closed and will remain closed until local authorities deem the area safe. We absolutely do not have a policy that dictates when team members can leave or return from a disaster, and the manager who posted this letter did not follow company guidelines. We can also confirm that the local franchise operator has addressed this situation with the manager involved.
It is unclear whether Pizza Hut employees in Florida who evacuated because of Irma would be protected from losing their jobs or eligibility for payment if their individual restaurants were closed or affected by the storm. Governor Rick Scott urged employers on 8 September 2017:
Be compassionate with your employees as they prepare for this storm and evacuate.
However, Florida is an “at-will” employment state, which allows employers to terminate workers without notice or cause, so long as the reason for their firing does not violate federal or state anti-discrimination laws. 
We contacted Pizza Hut asking if any workers who evacuated because of the storm were eligible for payment or at risk of being disciplined, but have not heard back."

							About this rating","On 10 September 2017, the White House’s social media director Dan Scavino, Jr. posted several images and videos showing the effects of historically huge Hurricane Irma, which ravaged the Caribbean region before moving up to Florida. 
One such video purported to show the massive storm hitting Miami International Airport, but is actually of a completely different weather system (Lidia) at a completely different location (Mexico’s Distrito Federal):

This video was taken at the Aeropuerto Internacional de la Ciudad de México on 30 August 2017, and it shows the effects of Tropical Storm Lidia, not Hurricane Irma:

The Miami International Airport’s Twitter account was quick to correct Scavino:

This video is not from Miami International Airport.

Scavino deleted the video, explaining that he was inundated with information when he shared his erroneous message:

Mexico had offered to send help to victims of Hurricane Harvey, which made landfall in Texas in August 2017 just days before its counterpart Irma hit the Caribbean, but rescinded the offer after a massive earthquake hit its Pacific coast on 8 September 2017, killing dozens and leaving millions of people in Mexico in need of aid."

							About this rating","On 11 September 2017, the web site EBUZZ.buzz posted a video on its Facebook page it described as the “Face Of Hurricane Irma !”:
<img loading=""lazy"" class=""aligncenter wp-image-103532 size-full"" style=""border: 1px solid black;"" src=""https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/09/Ebuzz-FB-cloud-face.jpg"" alt="""" width=""600"" height=""557"" data-recalc-dims=""1"" srcset=""https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/09/Ebuzz-FB-cloud-face.jpg?resize=600%2C557&amp;zoom=1 600w, https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/09/Ebuzz-FB-cloud-face.jpg?resize=600%2C557&amp;zoom=0.5 300w, https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/09/Ebuzz-FB-cloud-face.jpg?resize=600%2C557&amp;zoom=0.25 150w"" sizes=""(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"" />
The clip quickly went viral, amassing millions of views. But it is neither footage from Hurricane Irma — which was downgraded to a tropical storm hours after the video was posted — nor footage shot in Florida, the Caribbean, or in any location affected by the storm. As of 14 September 2017, this video — as well as one purportedly showing crabs swarming on a road because of the storm — has been pulled from EBUZZ’s Facebook page.
Another dubious Facebook page calling itself “Newsroom” attempted to pass it off as a “live” broadcast on 29 December 2017.
In fact, the footage of the unusual cloud formation was originally shot in the Canadian town of Grand Falls, New Brunswick and posted online on 1 August 2011 by Denis Laforge.
	
		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
 
Laforge can be heard in the clip saying:
A face. A face. Holy frig.
After the video began spreading online, he said:
I really wanted to be neutral when I put the video on YouTube. I’m not saying it was God’s face, the devil’s or any other. I’ve gotten comments that people have seen the villain in Harry Potter. I haven’t seen the last movie of the series so I’ll go see that for sure.
The site has recycled at least one more piece of footage and passed it off as something showing the effects of Irma. On 9 September 2017, it posted video of a double tornado, claiming that it was shot “live” in Florida. In reality, the video was posted in June 2007, and it shows two funnel clouds near the Italian island of Elba in August 2006."

						How To Seek Information on Loved Ones in Puerto Rico",null,null,"On 20 September 2017 the Category 4 Hurricane Maria made landfall in Puerto Rico, killing six people and knocking out power to the entire island.
In response to the difficulty people may be experiencing in reaching loved ones in the territory, the Puerto Rican Federal Affairs Administration (PRFAA) has urged anyone seeking “general information or assistance” to email their office at maria1@prfaa.pr.gov. The agency has also stated:
Due to the high volume of request being handled by the Disaster Relief Team, we kindly ask you not to send follow-up e-mails, unless your or your loved ones’ information has changed. If you were able to reach your loved ones, please inform us via e-mail as soon as possible.
PRFAA also established a web site, United for Puerto Rico, listing ways for people to donate funds via Paypal, using the ATH Móvil mobile app or by donating to a specific bank account number.
According to PRFAA, anyone looking to “make donations and/or volunteer” can also contact them by either calling them at 202-800-3134 or emailing them at maria2@prfa.pr.gov. Among the items requested are emergency supplies like mosquito repellant, medicine to treat diarrhea, diapers, baby formula, canned pet food, and first-aid kits. The site is also asking for donors who can provide construction supplies and volunteers who can receive material donations, as well as those who can store and ship them.
	
		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
The site also contains a map identifying emergency relief centers within the territory and listing contact numbers for both each center and the local officials supervising them.
A viral Facebook post also recommended calling two other numbers: 
Hurricane Hotlines numbers for Puerto Rico to call and check on Family and Friends.
202-778-0710 

787-777-0940

877-976-2400
Please copy and paste this post. <img class=""img"" role=""presentation"" src=""https://www.facebook.com/images/emoji.php/v9/f7f/1.5/16/1f1f5_1f1f7.png"" alt="""" width=""16"" height=""16"">
The second number is that of Puerto Rico’s local radio station, WIPR, which has also reportedly asked people seeking information to call them at 787-777-0940. However, we were not able to get through after multiple attempts. The WIPR web site was also down at press time, although their Facebook page is still functioning. 
The third phone number belongs to the Puerto Rico Tourism Company, which tweeted that it was a hotline for “hotels, guests, and industry partners”: 



 
However, at press time, the hotline appeared to no longer be working. 		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
Another post circulating on Facebook stated:
If anyone has contact with anyone in Puerto Rico, please spread the word that they have to reboot their phones in order to connect to the new cell phone towers. Please copy, paste and share.
However, it is unclear what the post means by “new towers.” Ramón Rosario Cortés, said in a press conference on 25 September 2017 that a local cell service provider, Claro, had erected towers in the “north and east” parts of the territory. But it is unclear whether these are new or restored towers that had already been in use. Cortés said that 27 percent of cell phone service had been re-estabished in the territory — but pointed out that this did not mean that 27 percent of its towers were working.
According to reports, some residents were able to get cell phone service by driving to locations near cell phone towers.
After hurricane Irma made landfall in Puerto Rico earlier in the month, Claro implemented an emergency plan, opening its service up to not only local homes, but schools, law enforcement, banks, hospitals, and emergency workers. But it is unclear whether this plan also involved new cellular towers.
The American Red Cross has also encouraged people to use its Safe and Sound online tracker (available in English and Spanish) to either search for loved ones or mark themselves as safe following the disaster.
In the absence of information, people desperate for information about their loved ones have taken to asking about specific towns, roads, and streets in the comments on Noticias 24/7 Facebook page (the news arm of WIPR) and the Facebook page PR Informa, which has been reporting updates about specific areas:

Several Facebook groups also cropped up in the aftermath to distribute news and announcements, and which some have been using to obtain information about their loved ones. Those included the open group Huracán María en Puerto Rico and the closed groups Huracan María en San lorenzo, Huracan maria mayaguez puerto rico, HURACAN MARIA CIDRA, and likely others. At least one person in Huracán María en Puerto Rico appeared to get some of the information she was seeking:

The destruction was not dramatic enough for some, however, as a doctored image showing a purported news ticker reading “Irma Now Contains Sharks,” surged on social media:

This image is, of course, a prank, with a news ticker digitally added as a reference to the Sharknado sci-fi movie series.

In this geocolor image captured by GOES-16 and released by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Hurricane Irma, a potentially catastrophic category 5 hurricane, moves westward, Tuesday morning, Sept. 5, 2017, in the Atlantic Ocean toward the Leeward Islands. This image was captured as daylight moves into the area, right, with nighttime features on the left side of the image. Hurricane Irma grew into a dangerous Category 5 storm, the most powerful seen in the Atlantic in over a decade, and roared toward islands in the northeast Caribbean Tuesday on a path that could eventually take it to the United States.

We got an extraordinary look at the physical reality of storm surge this weekend as Hurricane Irma seethed across the Straits of Florida. Storm surge doesn’t just mean there’s an excess of water in one place; it also mean there’s water missing from somewhere else. All that water didn’t come from nowhere, after all. 
The Atlantic included the same video as the Huffington Post, but attributed it to Twitter user @Kaydi_K, even though it was posted two hours earlier by @Piznack. It’s not clear who owns this particular video.

These videos appear to show a real meteorological phenomenon called “negative surge.”
Jamie Rhome, a storm surge specialist at the National Hurricane Center, confirmed to us that Hurricane Irma had caused negative surge. Rhome told us that the phenomenon occurs when “Winds ahead of the storm blow the water off the coast.”
It’s the same force that blows the water towards land [positive surge], except it’s blowing the water away from land. 
Receding tides could play a role in this phenomenon, but according to Rhome, hurricane-strength winds are the key force at play."

However, those flights were no longer listed by the evening. United spokesperson Frank Benenati told us that while the airline typically only has 12 flights out of Miami per day (compared to more than 400 out of Texas, parts of which suffered extreme damage from Hurricane Harvey earlier in the month), it added six one-way flights out of Miami and Ft. Lauderdale “to get more folks out” and capped the price for each at $399.
	
		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
Another exhorbitant listing posted online — which has also been corrected — showed a United flight from Miami to Atlanta on 7 September costing just over $6,300. Benenati called that post “a glitch in the computer”:
We flew one of our international wide-body jets down to Florida, a plane that doesn’t typically do that route. The system kind of had a little glitch on one of the seats and someone saw that and thought that those were the prices for all of the seats, which wasn’t true. The second we saw it online we fixed it.
Delta Airlines was also criticized in a widely-distributed tweet on 5 September 2017 that included a picture of a flight from Miami to Phoenix, Arizona priced at $3,258.00:
<img loading=""lazy"" class=""size-full wp-image-103220 aligncenter"" style=""border: 1px solid black;"" src=""https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/09/Delta-price-tweet-5-September-2017.jpg"" alt="""" width=""600"" height=""342"" data-recalc-dims=""1"" srcset=""https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/09/Delta-price-tweet-5-September-2017.jpg?resize=600%2C342&amp;zoom=1 600w, https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/09/Delta-price-tweet-5-September-2017.jpg?resize=600%2C342&amp;zoom=0.5 300w, https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/09/Delta-price-tweet-5-September-2017.jpg?resize=600%2C342&amp;zoom=0.25 150w"" sizes=""(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"" />
After the image was shared more than 39,000 times  on Twitter, the poster praised the airline in a follow-up tweet:

		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		

However, on 7 September, we found Delta flights to Newark International Airport in New Jersey for the same dates at just under $2,000:
<img loading=""lazy"" class=""size-full wp-image-103218 aligncenter"" style=""border: 1px solid black;"" src=""https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/09/Delta-via-Kayak-Miami-to-Newark-leaving-8-Sept.jpg"" alt="""" width=""600"" height=""388"" data-recalc-dims=""1"" srcset=""https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/09/Delta-via-Kayak-Miami-to-Newark-leaving-8-Sept.jpg?resize=600%2C388&amp;zoom=1 600w, https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/09/Delta-via-Kayak-Miami-to-Newark-leaving-8-Sept.jpg?resize=600%2C388&amp;zoom=0.5 300w, https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/09/Delta-via-Kayak-Miami-to-Newark-leaving-8-Sept.jpg?resize=600%2C388&amp;zoom=0.25 150w"" sizes=""(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"" />
In each case, those prices were not listed on Kayak by that evening. 
As the New York Times reported, those costly airfares may simply have been standard high-priced, last-minute fares that were only noticed due to the imminent arrival of a hurricane, not a deliberate attempt to price- gouge persons fleeing the storm:

The optics aren’t good for an industry that has had plenty of bad press recently, but the price increases causing the most recent public relations nightmare might just be business as usual.
“Sure, some are high, but last-minute fares are often more expensive in general,” George Hobica, the founder of AirfareWatchdog.com, wrote in an email. “I don’t think airlines would be callous or stupid enough to be consciously jacking up fares.”
Airfare data by Hopper shows that the price hikes that took place this past week are similar to those from two weeks ago, suggesting that the price changes are typical for a week of departure flights.
“If there’s any gouge, it’s just the last minute walk-up airfares that are designed for desperate business fliers,” Mr. Hobica said. “It’s just the computer programs doing what they do when it’s last minute and seats are scarce.”

Delta also released a statement on the controversy, saying that they would be capping fares for south Florida flights:
Delta has capped one-way fares in all cabins at $399 for flights to and from southern Florida through Sept. 13. Delta has been examining and adjusting fares in Florida since early this week, when Irma’s path became apparent and demand to fly out of the area surged.		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
Two other airlines, JetBlue and American Airlines, also instituted their own price caps for people looking to escape Irma as the hurricane headed toward Florida. The storm’s approach came less than a month after Hurricane Harvey caused widespread damage in southeast Texas.
Irma could also be followed soon by two other hurricanes, Jose and Katia. The sudden spate of potentially damaging storms, Benenati said, represents “a new dynamic” for United to contend with:
I think that Harvey and now Irma are not putting to the test what Mother Nature can do and the airlines will have to do as best they can in the situation that’s presented to them.
State Attorney General Pam Bondi has instituted a hotline for consumers to call if they suspected they were the victims of price-gouging. However, the state law against the practice only covers “essential items,” and not airline prices. An official with the Department of Transportation, which has jurisdiction over the issue, told us that the agency is currently evaluating complaints from areas affected by both Irma and Harvey.
A spokesperson for Bondi’s office, Kylie Mason, told us that more than 2,000 complaints about alleged price-gouging had been reported as of 7 September 2017. She added:
We are receiving complaints about airline tickets and have been in contact with airlines to request voluntary compliance.
Hurricane Irma, which has already killed at least 10 people, is projected to hit Florida’s southern region on 10 September 2017. Gov. Rick Scott (R) declared a state of emergency and as of press time, more than 650,000 residents of Miami-Dade County had been ordered to evacuate."

This content is shared here because the topic may interest Snopes readers; it does not, however, represent the work of Snopes fact-checkers or editors.","NEW YORK (AP) — It’s a paradox of hurricane coverage: people on television spend days warning the public to get out of harm’s way, then station their correspondents squarely in the middle of howling wind and rain and hope they don’t get hurt.
That was the case throughout Sunday’s gripping coverage of Hurricane Irma’s assault on Florida. Journalists were the shock troops allowing the nation to experience the storm from the comfort of their living rooms. Networks all brought their top teams in on the weekend for special coverage, non-stop on the news channels.
Yet when a huge tree limb crashed to the ground behind NBC’s Gabe Gutierrez, forcing him to scurry away during a live shot, it illustrated the danger many journalists faced. Network executives were one flying projectile away from a tragedy that would have them facing hard questions about whether they were placing a quest for exciting TV and ratings above common sense and public safety.
Several journalists who were outside sought the relative security of building balconies that blocked some of the wind or, like NBC’s Kerry Sanders, a concrete parking garage. Yet many felt they couldn’t truly convey the storm’s power without showing themselves getting buffeted by the elements.
The rain “does seem like it’s getting shot through a fire hose at you,” said CNN’s Chris Cuomo, assigned to Naples, Florida, as the intense eye wall passed over him.
	
		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
NBC’s Miguel Almaguer had a yellow tow line, one end wrapped around his waist and the other around a concrete pillar, to steady him as he did a live shot. ABC’s Gio Benitez also employed a rope as he stood on a balcony. CNN’s Kyung Lah gripped a metal railing.
Other correspondents frequently struggled to keep their footing. “I’m just taking a knee for a second,” said Sanders said when the wind got too intense. NBC’s Jo Ling Kent seemed fearless walking around Miami Beach. CBS’ Elaine Quijano spied some debris blowing her way; fortunately it proved only to be some palm fronds.
The wind blew The Weather Channel’s Mike Bettes several steps as he stood outside in Naples; later there was speculation that a small tornado blew behind him. But for a nerdy meteorologist, there was a payoff when he spotted a glimpse of the sun as the hurricane’s eye passed over him.
“After getting beaten and bruised and battered, there is the eye,” he said. “That is nice.”
Bettes’ Weather Channel colleague Mike Seidel, assigned to Miami, seemed a gust away from real danger as he stationed himself on a dock overrun by water, as wind whipped around. He eventually thought better of it.
“We’re going to be packing up and moving to higher ground,” he said.
Fox News Channel’s Steve Harrigan earned the assignment to stand outside in a hurricane on his birthday.
“I’m just sorry for old people, I’m sorry for people on oxygen,” he said. “I’m sorry for people out here who are scared. You know, we’ve been through them, we’re not scared. I just consider it a technical challenge trying to stay up and to stand here.”		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
After a couple of hours getting water blown in his face, CNN’s Cuomo was comfortable enough to offer advice to a colleague on positioning himself for a live shot: don’t stand with your back to the wind.
Cuomo’s experience passing through Irma’s eye offered some of the coverage’s most fascinating moments. Only minutes after getting hit by the worst of the winds, he found himself standing on a Naples street during a period of eerie calm. The palms stood limp beside him. He consulted with meteorologist Chad Myers, who was in a dry studio reading maps and estimating how many minutes Cuomo had until the wind would return, this time from the opposite direction.
“Now I get why people get lulled into a false sense of security,” he said, “because it does feel like it’s over.”
It wasn’t. The danger hadn’t passed for journalists or Florida, particularly as the challenge to capture storm surge added a fresh layer of risk.

						Florida Governor Rick Scott Critically Injured During Hurricane Irma Cleanup?","On 11 September 2017, Florida Governor Rick Scott was taken to hospital after being injured during a Hurricane Irma cleanup operation.","False
					
						
							About this rating","On 11 September 2017, the “satirical” website Last Line of Defense falsely reported that Florida Governor Rick Scott was in critical condition after injuring himself during a Hurricane Irma cleanup operation. 
Florida Governor Rick Scott was taken by Lifeflight to Mercy General In Sarasota this morning after taking part in a cleanup effort in his home town that went terribly wrong.
Scott’s Chief of Staff, Morton Valdy, told Fox News: “Governor Scott was struck in the head with a ceramic roof tile this morning while helping a neighbor in his home town clear debris from his driveway. The tile fell from the neighbor’s roof and fwell [sic] nearly 30 feet before striking the Governor, knocking him unconscious.”
Morton Valdy made no such comments to Fox News, because Morton Valdy does not exist. Rick Scott’s chief-of-staff is, in fact, Jackie Schutz Zeckman.
The story goes on to claim that President Donald Trump tweeted his condolences for the accident, something he never did, because the accident never took place.
Like everything else published by the Last Line of Defense, this story is a complete fabrication. The web site describes itself as a “satirical publication” in this disclaimer:
America’s Last Line of Defense is a satirical publication that may sometimes appear to be telling the truth. We assure you that’s not the case.

						Puerto Rican Hurricane Disaster Reignites Debate Over U.S. Shipping Law",null,null,"An outcry for federal assistance for Puerto Rico in the wake of a devastating September 2017 hurricane that spurred criticism from lawmakers has effectively suspended a 1920 law restricting maritime shipments to the island.
The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has refused requests to waive the provisions of the Merchant Marine Act of 1920 (also known as the Jones Act) in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria, which has reportedly already killed at least 44 people — including 16 in Puerto Rico — and left nearly all of the territory’s 3.4 million residents without electrical power since making landfall on 20 September 2017.
Puerto Rican Gov. Ricardo Rossello said on 27 September 2017 that he expects DHS to issue a waiver on the law, which requires that any shipments to U.S. territories like Guam and Puerto Rico — as well as non-mainland states like Alaska and Hawaii — be carried out by vessels that are not only owned by Americans, but based in the U.S. and maintaining a crew of U.S. citizens or permanent residents.
But a DHS spokesperson, David Lapan, told us that the circumstances surrounding Puerto Rico are different than the ones that led the agency to issue and extend a waiver on the law earlier in the month following the damage done in mainland U.S. states by Hurricanes Harvey and Irma.
Lapan said in a statement:
The fuel concerns associated with Hurricane Harvey were driven by the loss of numerous refineries and the shutdown of the primary pipeline moving refined fuel to the East Coast and Southeast. In those cases, we needed additional vessel capacity to make up for those loses. We do not lack US-flagged vessel capacity to move commodities to Puerto Rico, and restrictions on port operations and slowdowns at the port (e.g., cranes operating on generators are moving at half speed), and the above mentioned internal movement of goods, will be the primary limiting factors.
	
		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
As of 27 September 2017, Lapan told us, four ports in the territory were open, though not operational at full capacity. Another five were open “with restrictions,” while the rest of the local ports were still undergoing a federal assessment.
Two federal agencies, U.S Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) have dispatched aid to Puerto Rico.
But various lawmakers have criticized the federal government’s response. A group of Democratic House members called for a one-year suspension of the Jones Act in order to better allow supplies to be delivered by sea to Puerto Rico. Rep. Nydia M. Velázquez (D-New York) said in a statement that the hurricane was “a natural disaster of historic proportions.” Another lawmaker, Rep. Luis V. Gutiérrez (D-Illinois), said:
Puerto Rico is broke and the federal government already controls the purse strings through the financial control board or Junta that was imposed by Congress. Puerto Rico can’t borrow funds and they are required to use American shipping only, which is the most expensive in the world. In their hour of need, Washington can help by suspending the Jones Act and suspending cost-sharing obligations. Puerto Rico was closing schools and hospitals and laying off cops before the two hurricanes hit this month, so Washington should go these extra steps.
Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona — who introduced a bill in July 2017 calling for the law to be repealed — released a statement on 26 September 2017 saying that he was “very concerned” by DHS’s decision not to grant Puerto Rico the same waiver against the law that Texas, Florida, and Louisiana received. He said:
It is unacceptable to force the people of Puerto Rico to pay at least twice as much for food, clean drinking water, supplies and infrastructure due to Jones Act requirements as they work to recover from this disaster. Now, more than ever, it is time to realize the devastating effect of this policy and implement a full repeal of this archaic and burdensome Act.
The Federal Reserve Bank of New York said in a 2014 report that granting Puerto Rico a five-year waiver from the Jones Act would help determine whether its restrictions contributed to the “substantial burden” caused by the high cost of shipping there.
However, the American Maritime Partnership — an advocacy group comprised of workers’ groups, contractors, and other organizations tied to the shipbuilding industry — has argued that the law is “critical to our country’s economic surgery”:
The 40,000 Jones Act vessels operating in the domestic trades support nearly 500,000 American jobs and almost $100 billion in annual economic impact. An impressive five indirect jobs are created for every one direct maritime job, which results in more than $28 billion in labor compensation. The industry moves close to 888 million tons of cargo every year, which plays an important role in relieving congestion on the nation’s crowded roads and railways.
On 28 September 2017, the Trump administration announced that it was waiving the Jones Act effective immediately at the behest of Puerto Rico’s governor:

At @ricardorossello request, @POTUS has authorized the Jones Act be waived for Puerto Rico. It will go into effect immediately.
