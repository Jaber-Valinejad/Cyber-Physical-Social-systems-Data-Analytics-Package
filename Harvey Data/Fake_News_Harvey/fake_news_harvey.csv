							About this rating","In September 2019, shortly after Hurricane Dorian devastated the Bahamas, a rumor started to circulate on Facebook claiming that U.S. President Donald Trump had personally donated $1 million to the relief fund for the Caribbean country:
<img loading=""lazy"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-213534"" src=""https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2019/09/69603164_2362909323777569_967276959191007232_n.jpg"" alt="""" width=""540"" height=""960"" data-recalc-dims=""1"" srcset=""https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2019/09/69603164_2362909323777569_967276959191007232_n.jpg?resize=540%2C960&amp;zoom=1 540w, https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2019/09/69603164_2362909323777569_967276959191007232_n.jpg?resize=540%2C960&amp;zoom=0.5 270w, https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2019/09/69603164_2362909323777569_967276959191007232_n.jpg?resize=540%2C960&amp;zoom=0.25 135w"" sizes=""(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px"" />This rumor is unfounded. 
Although verbatim copies of this message — “President Trump donated $1 million dollars to the relief fund for The Bahamas. No politicians have donated ANYTHING. ZERO” — were shared by a number of Facebook users (as well as a few variants), we’ve yet to come across any posting that linked the claim to a credible news report.
Furthermore, neither Trump nor the White House has announced any personal donations from the president to the Bahamas. We reached out to White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham for comment but did not hear back by press time.
While this rumor is based on a series of unsourced social media posts, it isn’t far-fetched. Trump truly donated $1 million to the recovery effort in Texas and Louisiana in the wake of Hurricane Harvey in 2017:
President Donald Trump and the first lady, Melania, personally donated $1 million to Hurricane Harvey relief efforts, the White House said Wednesday in announcing which charities had been selected.
The donation was divided among 12 charities, including the Red Cross, Salvation Army, Reach Out America and the ASPCA. The White House previously requested recommendations of where Trump should send his money and “several of the following organizations were recommended … by members of the White House Press Corps.”
	
		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
Perhaps some social media users came across one of the 2017 reports about Trump’s donation to a hurricane-relief effort and mistook them for recent news. As of this writing, however, no such donation has been announced for the Bahamas in 2019. 
When Trump took office in January 2017, he pledged to donate the entirety of his presidential salary (approximately $400,000 annually) to various causes. Trump has kept this promise. As of this writing, Trump’s most recent donation ($100,000) went to the Department of Health and Human Services:
President Donald Trump wrote a check to donate his second quarter 2019 salary to the office of the Surgeon General to fund an upcoming public health advisory, the White House told USA TODAY.
It’s his third salary donation to the Department of Health and Human Services.
“The President recognizes the important mission of the Surgeon General to protect and improve the health of all Americans, including helping to tackle the opioid epidemic and raise awareness of the dangers of e-cigarette usage among teenagers and children,” the White House said in a statement.
While the White House has publicized these donations, they have made no announcements regarding a $1 million personal donation from the president to the relief effort in the Bahamas. The U.S. government, on the other hand, started to provide aid to the Caribbean country almost immediately. 
A spokesperson for the State Department told us that the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) is working to “provide humanitarian assistance, search and rescue, and other disaster response measures” to the Bahamian government. USAID will also be providing nearly $3 million in additional humanitarian assistance to help the recovery effort:
At the request of Prime Minister Minnis of the Bahamas, the United States is providing assistance to the people of the Bahamas in the wake of Hurricane Dorian. Hurricane Dorian began to make landfall in the Bahamas on September 1, 2019, and is the strongest storm to ever hit The Bahamas, the second strongest Atlantic storm measured by wind speed on record. The U.S. Embassy to The Bahamas and United States Agency for International Development (USAID), are a part of the whole-of-Federal Government effort to provide humanitarian assistance, search and rescue, and other disaster response measures at the request of the Bahamian government, as well as assisting U.S. citizens in the affected areas. We appreciate Prime Minister Minnis’ leadership through this difficult time and remain in close contact with all levels of the Bahamian Government as we work together to respond to this disaster.
On September 7, USAID Administrator Mark Green announced $1 million in additional humanitarian assistance to help people in The Bahamas affected by Hurricane Dorian, bringing USAID’s total funding for this response to $2.8 million to date. This new funding will provide emergency food assistance to people in areas worst affected by the hurricane. USAID’s funding is also providing urgently needed shelter, water containers, and hygiene kits to people in need, as well as providing critically needed logistics support to help move commodities to The Bahamas.
We refer you to the White House for information about any personal action taken by the president."

As if the city of Houston hasn’t seen enough tragedy due to catastrophic flooding from Hurricane Harvey, things took a turn for the worse today after a U.S. Navy ship collided with a building in the downtown area.
The ship was identified as an Arleigh Burke-class destroyer belonging to the Navy’s 7th Fleet.
It was unclear why the destroyer was not able to see the building and take evasive action, or why it was over 20 miles inland and trying to navigate through a major metropolitan area.
The story isn’t real. The Duffel Blog carries a readily available disclaimer:

The featured photograph that accompanied the story is, unsurprisingly, fake. The real image was published in 2015 and showed flood waters (sans Navy ship) approaching downtown Houston. Here is the real image and the doctored one that Duffel Blog used side by side:

						Can Animal Rescuers Be Prosecuted for Theft for Saving Animals from Harvey?",Anyone who rescues an animal from dangers caused by Tropical Storm Harvey can be prosecuted for theft of an animal in Texas.,"False
					
						
							About this rating","With humanitarian and rescue operations underway in response to Tropical Storm Harvey in Texas, rumors are cropping up that could discourage the rescue of animals in danger. 
Snopes readers wrote in to ask about the following warning: 
State law says until [animals are] chest deep [in water or mud], they can’t be touched by anyone other than the owner, otherwise it’s horse theft. Even law enforcement officers can’t pull them until that point.
What the law says
There is no law in Texas that specifically states when an animal rescue is or is not a theft — either because of water and mud levels or any other circumstance. 
	
		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
Stealing horses, cattle, “exotic livestock”, or ten or more sheep, goats or pigs is a third-degree felony in Texas if the total value of the animals is up to $150,000. (Sec 31.03 e 5).
While there is no provision in Texas law which allows an exception specifically for rescuing an animal from a flood, it is extremely unlikely — almost unimaginable — that someone who rescued an animal from death or injury would be prosecuted for theft (unless, of course, they later refused to return the animal to its owner). 
For one thing, prosecutors (usually district attorneys) have limited resources and have to prioritize only the most urgent and egregious crimes. A herd of cattle or a dozen horses being removed from their owner’s possession during a devastating natural disaster of historic proportions would not fall into this category.
Secondly, prosecutors generally avoid pursuing cases they are not likely to win — and they are not likely to convince a jury to convict of theft a person who acted to save an animal’s life. Moreover, such a case would probably bring the prosecutor, who is usually an elected official, negative attention. 
Jeremy Rosenthal, a Texas-based criminal defense attorney and former prosecutor at the Collin County District Attorney’s office, told us that, according to Texas law, prosecutors can and should refuse to prosecute cases that do not advance the cause of justice. Article 2.01 of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure says that the “primary duty” of prosecutors is “not to convict, but o see that justice is done.” 
Rosenthal calls this “the common sense factor.”
A prosecutor’s job isn’t to hit somebody with the maximum that they can hit them with, it’s to see that justice is done.
However, even if a prosecutor – for whatever reason – decided to pursue an individual who had taken an animal from its owner in order to save its life, that individual would have several legal defenses available to them which would make conviction extremely unlikely.  		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
Both Rosenthal and Marcia Kramer, a lawyer and Director of Legal and Legislative Programs for the Animal Law Resource Center at the National Anti-Vivisection Society, both told us that the first line of defense in a case like this would likely be the defense of “necessity.”  
The Necessity Defense
Texas Penal Code Section 9.22 offers a kind of blanket defense against criminal prosecution of many kinds, which would include theft:

Conduct is justified if:
(1) the actor reasonably believes the conduct is immediately necessary to avoid imminent harm;

(2) the desirability and urgency of avoiding the harm clearly outweigh, according to ordinary standards of reasonableness, the harm sought to be prevented by the law proscribing the conduct; and

(3) a legislative purpose to exclude the justification claimed for the conduct does not otherwise plainly appear.

“Necessity,” Rosenthal says, “is basically where there is greater harm that results from not taking the action.”
You could make the case – very clearly – that this horse, these cattle were going to die unless I acted.
The ‘Deprivation Defense’
Both Kramer and Rosenthal also pointed out that the very definition of theft in Texas seems to exclude a good faith animal rescue. 		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
The Texas Penal Code (Sec. 31.03 a) states that “A person commits an offense if he unlawfully appropriates property with intent to deprive the owner of property.”
However, “deprive” is defined as follows (Sec. 31.01 2):

(A) to withhold property from the owner permanently or for so extended a period of time that a major portion of the value or enjoyment of the property is lost to the owner;

(B) to restore property only upon payment of reward or other compensation; or

(C) to dispose of property in a manner that makes recovery of the property by the owner unlikely.

Kramer says:
Since the rescue is not meant to deprive the owner of the enjoyment of the value of their property (animal), but rather to preserve the value (the life) of the animal, a rescue does not qualify as a theft under Texas law. The element of “intent” is absent from animal rescue.
Rosenthal pointed out that if someone who rescued an animal later refused to return it to its owner, that could, of course, be treated as theft."

						Does This Social Media Narrative Describe Volunteers Helping with Hurricane Dorian?",A social media post describes volunteers headed to Florida to help with Hurricane Dorian relief in September 2019.,"Mixture
					
						
							About this rating","In September 2019, as Americans were tracking the unpredictable path of Hurricane Dorian and fearing it might make landfall in Florida, many social media users, including conservative columnist Todd Starnes, shared a post with a picture showing a procession of vehicles towing small boats. The accompanying text identified the drivers as volunteers headed out to help potential storm victims in Florida and the Carolinas:
Several of our readers sent me a link to this incredible Facebook post written by a gentleman named Floyd Richard Burdett. It’s word a read, folks. Full disclosure – I cannot independently verify where the photograph was taken.
There are still plenty of red-blooded American men who are willing to head towards the danger zone – girded by Almighty God and toxic masculinity. We got word that the Cajun Navy is already on the ground in Florida.
One of those guys is my cousin, who is part of a swift water rescue team from Memphis. They are headed to Jacksonville, Florida.
Y’all say a prayer for these brave men and the good people of Florida and the Carolinas.

Let this sink in for a minute…..Hundreds and hundreds of small boats pulled by countless pickups and SUVs from across the South are headed for Florida.
Almost all of them driven by men. They’re using their own property, sacrificing their own time, spending their own money, and risking their own lives for one reason: to help total strangers in desperate need …

Although volunteers may indeed have begun heading to Florida and/or the Carolinas to offer assistance during Hurricane Dorian in early September 2019, this particular photograph and text is dated from two years earlier and pictured members of Lousiana’s “Cajun Navy” headed to Texas (not Florida) to help rescue victims of Hurricane Harvey (not Hurricane Dorian) in August 2017 (not 2019):
The Houston Chronicle described the Cajun Navy’s efforts in Texas at the time as follows:
Texans are getting help from their neighbors who know too well the dangers hurricanes can bring.
The Cajun Navy, a band of Louisiana residents who used their boats and resources to rescue people during Hurricane Katrina, have been authorized to come to Texas and help rescue Hurricane Harvey victims.
At the beginning of September 2019, a representative of the Cajun Navy 2016 group said they were prepared to help with Hurricane Dorian but at the moment were unsure where to head due to the uncertain path of the storm:
<img loading=""lazy"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-212910"" src=""https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2019/09/cajunnavy.jpg"" alt="""" width=""1189"" height=""678"" data-recalc-dims=""1"" srcset=""https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2019/09/cajunnavy.jpg?resize=1189%2C678&amp;zoom=1 1189w, https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2019/09/cajunnavy.jpg?resize=1189%2C678&amp;zoom=0.5 595w, https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2019/09/cajunnavy.jpg?resize=1189%2C678&amp;zoom=0.25 297w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1189px) 100vw, 1189px"" />
Like many of us, Ben Husser has been getting updates on Hurricane Dorian from the news. But unlike the rest of us, he and the search and rescue crew from Cajun Navy 2016 are headed to the action.
“Our first group is probably going to leave Monday or Monday night [September 2],” said Husser.
Husser is a volunteer for the Cajun Navy 2016. He and his team do strictly search and rescue missions, but at this point, they don’t know where they are headed. This makes planning to help those in need, even more difficult, Husser say.
“As of right now we’re looking at 3 or 4 different locations,” said Husser …
Husser says the Cajun Navy 2016 are second responders and will only take their boats to places where they have permission. But for now, they are waiting and watching the storm closely to follow its path.
In short, the gist of this social media post circulated in 2019 and describing the helpful efforts of some volunteers during hurricanes is true, but it was written about events that took place two years earlier, during a different storm in a different location."

						NASA Warns ‘Planet X’ Is Headed Straight for Earth?",NASA has warned of imminent disaster due to the trajectory of another planet that will  intersect Earth's orbit.,"False
					
						
							About this rating","On 10 March 2016, the web site News4KTLA published an article  reporting that NASA had issued a frightening advisory concerning the possibility that the trajectory a “rogue planet” known as “Nibiru” or “Planet X” would intersect Earth’s orbit, with potentially disastrous consequences:
Is this the end of the world as we know it? Doomsayers have prophesied for decades about a giant, rogue planet in our solar system — dubbed Planet X or Nibiru — that has the capacity of colliding or passing near Earth, with catastrophic consequences. And of course, NASA has known about the mystery planet for years, but declined to warn us … until now. Finally, after the announcement of “Planet Nine” in January, conspiracy theorists have proved to the skeptics that they have been right this entire time, and NASA finally has to admit its wrongs. The planet, according to Caltech researchers, has a mass about 10 times that of Earth and takes about 15,000 years to make a full orbit around the sun – And it’s heading towards Earth, with a collision date of August 21, 2016. Although Caltech researchers have admitted that we are headed for doomsday. NASA continues to tiptoe around the subject.
“Although our scientists at NASA have emphasized for years that Nibiru doesn’t exist, we are ready to reveal the fact that it does exist,” said NASA spokesperson Heather Cartwright. “The truth is we have been tracking the object for at least a decade and it is definitely headed towards planet Earth. However, we are expecting a close flyby – not the doomsday collision that Caltech researchers are predicting. There is no need to cause mass panic.” In a response to NASA’s statement, Caltech researcher Randall Smith had this to say: “For NASA to minimize the threat to our earth by calling it a ‘close flyby’ is insulting to our research. We have concrete evidence that proves Nibiru is headed straight for earth with a collision that will destroy life as we know it. NASA is just trying to avoid mass panic and chaos within our world. But we all deserve to know that our days are numbered.”
This report was untrue, just another clickbait fabrication originating with News4KTLA, a fake news site that has appropriated the call letters of a legitimate Los Angeles television station and news outlet (KTLA).
NASA has never issued any such warning, nor reported the existence of any “rogue planet.”  In fact, NASA has stated just the opposite, that no planet such as “Niburu” is known to exist:

	
		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
Nonetheless, fringe religious elements periodically invoke doomsday scenarios that posit an apocalypse brought about by another planet’s passing in close proximity to Earth, with one such instance supposedly set to occur on 23 September 2017, as reported by Fox News:

Christian numerologists claim that the world will end on Sept. 23, 2017 as they believe a planet will collide with Earth.
According to Christian numerologist David Meade, verses in Luke 21: 25 to 26 is the sign that recent events, such as the recent solar eclipse and Hurricane Harvey, are signs of the apocalypse.
The verses read:
“25: There will be signs in the sun, moon and stars. On the earth, nations will be in anguish and perplexity at the roaring and tossing of the sea. People will faint from terror, apprehensive of what is coming on the world, for the heavenly bodies will be shaken.’
“’26: Men’s hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth: for the powers of heaven shall be shaken.’
Sept. 23 is a date that was pinpointed using codes from the Bible, as well as a “date marker” in the pyramids of Giza in Egypt.
Meade has built his theory, which is viewed with a widely skeptical lens, on the so-called Planet X, which is also known as Nibiru, which he believes will pass Earth on Sept. 23, causing volcanic eruptions, tsunamis and earthquakes.

Ed Stetzer, a pastor and executive director of Wheaton College’s Billy Graham Center, took exception to such reporting in a piece published on the web site of Christianity Today:

First, there is no such thing as a legitimate ‘Christian numerologist.’
Sure, the writers of Scripture do, indeed, use numbers to point to a few things—that’s first-year seminary. But, it stops at first-year seminary because there are not secret numerical codes that require a profession called “Christian numerology.”
Seminaries don’t offer this as a formal degree nor do any professional, accredited institutions. David Meade, the man the Fox News article cites as their source for these claims, doesn’t have any formal, academic training in numerology.
That’s right, multiple news outlets are referencing the findings of a man with, according to his website, nothing more than a bachelor’s degree in Economics and Astrology from an unnamed institution.
Furthermore, Meade doesn’t provide us with evidence of any biblical training he has received in order to speak authoritatively about the end times. He is discussing biblical matters of profound significance and making predictions about events of global importance without any real authority on these topics.
To make matters worse, the planetary alignments that Meade is using to support his claims about the end of the world have, according to an Express article, already happened four times in the past 1000 years.
Meade is a made-up leader in a made-up field, and should not be on the front page of anything, let alone Fox News.
And, when we remind people of this, maybe they will be less likely to report on it next time."

						Are There Floating Islands of Fire Ants in Hurricane-Flooded Areas of Texas?",There are small islands of fire ants floating in the floodwaters from Tropical Storm Harvey.,"True
					
						
							About this rating","It may sound like a horrific scene from an “Indiana Jones” movie, but clusters of fire ants are floating through catastrophic floodwaters caused by Tropical Storm Harvey, which made landfall in southeast Texas in late August 2017.
As waters rose throughout the Houston area causing widespread destruction and displacement, people began posting another unpleasant effect of the storm — surreal pictures of the rust-colored insects drifting along, tightly clinging together to form what look like rafts on the surface of flooding rain water — prompting some to ask if the images were real. They are, in fact, real.
Houston Chronicle medical reporter Mike Hixenbaugh posted a video of one such colony, urging residents to keep their distance:

Pro tip: Don’t touch the floating fire ant colonies. They will ruin your day. #Harvey pic.twitter.com/uwJd0rA7qB
— Mike Hixenbaugh (@Mike_Hixenbaugh) August 27, 2017
The ant colonies have become large enough to prompt alarm from an entomologist from the University of Texas, Austin:

Holy crap. I have never, in my entire career as an ant researcher, seen *anything* like this. https://t.co/jIjTOo3fZc
— Alex Wild (@Myrmecos) August 29, 2017
Hixenbaugh is right to urge caution. According to the Washington Post, fire ants are “aggressive, territorial and venomous. Among vulnerable individuals, their stings can be fatal”. According to Paul Nester, an extension program specialist in integrated pest management, the phenomenon of floating colonies of fire ants in a rain storm is not unprecedented:
Floodwaters will not drown fire ants. Instead, their colonies emerge from the soil, form a loose ball, float, and flow with the water until they reach a dry area or object they can crawl up on. Floating fire ant colonies can look like ribbons, streamers, mats, rafts, or an actual “ball” of ants floating on the water. These amoeba-like ant masses contain all of the colonies’ members: brood (eggs, larvae, pupae), queen ants, winged reproductive males and females, and worker ants.
As the flood waters recede, these floating fire ant colonies will get onto anything they come in contact with and are attracted to — anything that might give them shelter until a mound can be re-established in the soil. This means that debris piles left from the floodwaters or from flooded homes are extremely inviting to the fire ant. In times of flooding, a general, preventive treatment for controlling the fire ants is out of the question. Ants and ant colonies must be dealt with quickly.
Although it’s possible to sink the ants by spraying them with water and dish soap, which breaks them apart, experts from Texas A&M told science and technology site The Verge that spraying them would bring you too close, and the best course of action is to simply avoid them. If they’re floating in your direction, try to create waves that move them away. If one stings, it creates a chain reaction that induces the others to sting — so the best thing to do is brush them off as quickly as possible."

The Red Cross…threatened the pastors, threatened the priest, and threatened [others]. They began to steal – yes, I said it – the Red Cross was physically taking these donations from the doorsteps of these churches and putting them into their trucks. [The] Red Cross came to the church, with volunteers, and began to steal the donations…The Red Cross was stealing from people who literally had nothing…and they were protected by Order EO 13603. They were protected by Barack Obama, who signed this executive order.
Nelms earlier described that executive order in this way:
Obama claimed authority under the Defense Production Act of 1950, a Korean War-era statute…. It gives government power to marshal whatever resources they want. 
This description is similar to the language used in a 26 August 2015 article on the Natural News web site, which reported, falsely, that the executive order had had the effect of nationalizing the supply of food in the United States. (It also bears significant resemblance to the language often used by the sovereign citizen movement.)
	
		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
In her Facebook video, Gina Nelms also claims that the Red Cross had taken the donated items it had purportedly stolen back to its “setup shelter” in Houston, before sorting through them for items it could sell for profit, and burning the remaining donations in dumpsters: 
Case after case after case of water, and they turned around and sold the water for $1.25 apiece…What they could make a profit off of, they kept. What they could not make a profit off of, they decided to put into these dumpsters, and they were burning your donations.
Nelms also encouraged viewers to “run the Red Cross out of Texas”.
Her central claim — that the Red Cross stole donations in Houston and sold some for profit, while burning others — is not supported by any evidence; the Red Cross unequivocally denies it. We could also find no evidence to support Gina Nelms’ claim that the Red Cross had “threatened” clergy members or anyone else during the alleged episode. The claim that the Red Cross was authorized to confiscate property by an Obama-era executive order, however, is entirely false. 
We sent Nelms a series of questions seeking to establish whether she had personally witnessed the events she described in her video, requesting any evidence that might support her claims, including the names of the churches involved, and asking her to connect us to any other person who might be able to provide such evidence. We did not receive a response. Nelms has also repeatedly stated in several Facebook videos that she has photographs and videos which would prove that her claims about the Red Cross are true, but has so far not provided these photographs and videos.
The Red Cross released a statement addressing the matter:
This is most definitely not an accurate claim — and we have asked Ms. Nelms to share any details, locations of these churches, or names of anyone involved in her assertion — and she has failed to do so.
[…]
As a humanitarian organization, we vehemently deny stealing anything to support our work. Very often, local churches and organizations collect donated items on behalf of our relief efforts – and then pass them on to the Red Cross. As an organizational policy, we do not sell or burn donated items. At times, donations are soiled or spoiled, in which case, they are discarded. We also do not accept donations of non-palletized (or non-bulk) food items, and in those cases, we partner with other local organizations to help us process and distribute those donations. Consequently, we find it highly objectionable that Ms. Nelms has made this claim.
A spokesperson also said the Red Cross has so far been “unable to validate” the claim that someone from the organization had “threatened” clergy members and others outside a church or churches in Houston: 
With nearly 200 shelters open at the height of this response, and without any confirmation or detail from Ms. Nelms, we have no idea who or what she is referring to. I can say that we have not and do not threaten people, whether pastors or residents of our shelters.
Executive order 13603 was signed by President Barack Obama on 16 March 2012, and it was an update to previous versions of a similar order signed by several presidents in earlier decades, most recently by Bill Clinton in 1994.
Contrary to Nelms’ claim, it does not empower the government to “marshall whatever resources they want.” The order essentially mandates that cabinet secretaries and federal agency heads should periodically assess the readiness of the United States’ industrial and technological capacity to respond effectively to threats to national security. (Its provisions can be read here.)
The order does not authorize the federal government to seize private property. Furthermore, the Red Cross is not part of the federal government anyway. It is a nonprofit humanitarian organization, not a federal agency. So even if EO 13603 did authorize the government to seize property, it would not authorize the Red Cross to seize property.
This component of Gina Nelms’ claim is therefore wildly false, and appears to be based on a fundamental misunderstanding of what the Red Cross is and how it operates."

						Are These Vegan Foods Left Unsold During the COVID-19 Pandemic?",A photograph shows store shelves stripped of all foodstuffs except for vegan products during the COVID-19 pandemic.,"Miscaptioned
					
						
							About this rating","The COVID-19 coronavirus disease pandemic that began spreading globally in the first part of 2020 prompted runs on grocery stores and other food outlets that left many store shelves stripped bare of consumables. As social media users began sharing photographs of barren shelves to document the extent of the situation, a few delighted in posting pictures that showed a few foodstuffs left behind in otherwise empty stores — with the implication that these comestibles were so awful tasting that people were unwilling to purchase them, even in a time of crisis.
One common subject of such photographs was food identified (correctly or otherwise) as being “vegan” (i.e., containing no animal products). One particular picture of that nature was shared by multiple Facebook and Twitter users:

Not even the threat of starvation from a panic buying food shortage can move vegan food off the shelves.. pic.twitter.com/LlJLqYlvXH

Although the photograph may be fairly representative of the general concept and does picture some vegan food products, it did not originate with the COVID-19 pandemic.
The earliest versions of this picture we were able to find online had been posted well over two years before the COVID-19 outbreak and dated from September 2017 — just after Hurricane Harvey made landfall in Texas and Louisiana in August 2017 and prompted a similar run on grocery stores by residents in the storm’s path:"

						Is the Red Cross Charging Victims of Hurricane Harvey for Disaster Relief Services?",The American Red Cross is charging victims of Hurricane Harvey for their services.,"False
					
						
							About this rating","In the wake of the devastating flooding caused by Hurricane Harvey in late August 2017, many began donating to the Red Cross to support their disaster relief efforts. This, in turn, has allowed old rumors that the American Red Cross charges for disaster relief services to resurface — a false claim which we have already analyzed, and which is rooted in the fact that the Red Cross did, at one time, charge WWII soldiers for off-base food and lodging.
Just to make sure their policy regarding disaster assistance has not changed since the last time these claims surfaced, we reached out to the Red Cross to ask if they charged for any disaster relief related services in the wake of Harvey. A media representative assured us that all Red Cross disaster assistance is provided free of charge.
The rumors, this time, seem to have spread most rapidly from a 28 August 2017 post (“Why You Shouldn’t Donate To The Red Cross To Help Hurricane Victims”) by Affinity Magazine, which makes the statement that some disaster victims never received money collected by the organization that was ostensibly there to help them: 

When the World Trade Center went down back in 2001, the Red Cross this time raised over a billion dollars in donations. Again, victims of the terrorist attack never saw the money. They opened only a few shelters during the attack and no one came to them. They even handed out coffee and donuts for the rescue workers on site, yet charged them for the food and drinks.

The specific claim of charging rescue workers for food and drinks, according to links within the Affinity Magazine post, stems from a 2005 Huffington Post article written by Richard Walden, president of the disaster relief charity Operation USA. In that piece, he states that the Red Cross was accused of that activity — which he told us via e-mail was “widely-known” — but of which we can find no direct evidence:

The Red Cross responded to 9/11 by opening a few shelters to which no one came; tried to trace missing persons but were pushed aside when the World Trade Center site was dubbed a crime scene and police and FBI took over identification of missing persons; and, served coffee and donuts to rescue workers at the World Trade Center site only to be accused of charging for them. (It later paid Daniel Bouley, New York’s star chef, to cook for them after the news about charging for coffee was made public.)

	
		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
What is certainly true, however, is that the Red Cross has a controversial history with disaster relief, and that it has been the focus of numerous unflattering investigations about the use of the funds raised in these times of crisis. After the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001, the Red Cross caused major controversy by initially announcing that not all of the funds raised for those relief efforts would go to 9/11 related activities, as reported by the New York Times in 2002:

The agency’s first efforts to get aid quickly to people were marked by missteps and delays. The Red Cross’s announcement that it intended to withhold some $200 million raised after Sept. 11 for future disasters provoked outrage among victims and donors and angry Congressional hearings. And the agency, under attack, found itself having to name former Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine as special administrator of its Sept. 11 relief program.

Their response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005, similarly, raised questions about what the Red Cross does — and is actually able to do — with funds raised in the wake of humanitarian crises and disasters. A ProPublica and NPR investigation released in 2014 alleged widespread failure to meet the needs of both Hurricane Isaac and Sandy, which both occurred in 2012:

The Red Cross botched key elements of its mission after Sandy and Isaac, leaving behind a trail of unmet needs and acrimony, according to an investigation by ProPublica and NPR. The charity’s shortcomings were detailed in confidential reports and internal e-mails, as well as accounts from current and former disaster relief specialists.
What’s more, Red Cross officials at national headquarters in Washington, D.C. compounded the charity’s inability to provide relief by “diverting assets for public relations purposes,” as one internal report puts it. Distribution of relief supplies, the report said, was “politically driven.”

Most infamous, perhaps, was the Red Cross response to the Earthquake in Haiti, which — as ProPublica and NPR also reported — alleged that the Red Cross “Raised Half a Billion Dollars for Haiti ­and Built Six Homes”. Their main problem, as alleged in this report, was that the Red Cross did not know how to handle the massive funds they were given:

Lacking the expertise to mount its own projects, the Red Cross ended up giving much of the money to other groups to do the work. Those groups took out a piece of every dollar to cover overhead and management. Even on the projects done by others, the Red Cross had its own significant expenses — in one case, adding up to a third of the project’s budget.

On 31 August 2017, the Red Cross detailed how it would be spending its funds for Harvey, introducing that documentation with this statement:

The American Red Cross has been truly humbled by the outpouring of public support for those affected by Hurricane Harvey. Working around the clock, the Red Cross is making good use of donations and bringing help where it is needed. Each cot holding a sleeping child, each meal served to a family who is hungry and each blanket a disaster worker wraps around someone wet from the floodwaters is a result of a generous donation. As the storm moves north, flash flood emergencies are in effect throughout the Gulf Coast, and the storm may produce as much as a foot of rain through the end of the week.

Past controversies aside, there is no evidence that the Red Cross is charging Hurricane Harvey victims for disaster relief services and the Red Cross explicitly states it does not charge for these services. As such, we rank this specific claim false."

							About this rating","On July 25, 2020, Hurricane Hanna made landfall in southern Texas, the first storm to do so since Hurricane Harvey in 2017. Shortly afterwards, social media users began circulating a video clip said to show Hanna “blowing down Trump’s border wall”:



 

Although the video was real, it didn’t capture Hurricane Hanna blowing down a section of border fencing in Texas in July 2020, but rather a similar occurrence in a different time and place.  
This clip was actually shot in the state of New Mexico in early June 2020, according to a statement from U.S. Customs and Border Protection spokesperson Roderick Kise: “U.S. Customs and Border Protection is not aware of any border wall panels falling over due to Hurricane Hanna hitting the Rio Grande Valley Sector this past weekend. The video circulating on social media appears to be from June 2020 when high winds caused several border wall panels that were pending additional anchoring to fall over at a construction site near Deming, New Mexico.”
The Associated Press also quoted a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers spokesperson as confirming that information:

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is overseeing the ongoing wall construction south of Deming, including the section of wall featured in the video. Raini Brunson, a Corps spokesperson, confirmed the details about the video, but had no information about who filmed the footage.
“The incident involving the unexpected high wind gust, which knocked over the barrier panels, occurred on June 5th,” Brunson wrote in an email.
Brunson said after the wall panels blew down, “the contractor revised its barrier panel-bracing procedures and work has continued on the project without further incident.”"

							About this rating","On 26 April 2018, comedian Bill Cosby was found guilty on three counts of aggravated indecent assault.
Shortly thereafter, the satirical web site Babylon Bee published an article claiming that Planned Parenthood had issued a statement in defense of the former sitcom star, arguing that sexual assault only made up a small percentage of Cosby’s actions:
President Cecile Richards came forward to claim that since sexual assault is only about 3% of what Bill Cosby performed over his long and illustrious career, the egregious offenses should be overlooked.
“Look, guys, let’s keep this in perspective,” she said in a press conference held at Planned Parenthood’s New York offices. “Cosby provided many needed services, like laughter, stand-up comedy, and a solid sitcom. You can’t paint him with the broad brush of ‘sexual offender’ just because a very small percentage of his activities were horrifying and abusive.”
The Babylon Bee is an entertainment web site with long history of publishing satirical articles. In this case, the web site appears to be spoofing an often-quoted statistic about the nonprofit organization; although many people may equate it with abortion, Planned Parenthood’s annual report states that these procedures only make up 3 percent of the medical services that they provide:

						Did FEMA Use Barges to Incarcerate People Fleeing a Volcano in Hawaii?","In June 2018, FEMA deployed barges to Hawaii, to transport victims of the Kilauea volcano to an ""internment camp.""","False
					
						
							About this rating","In June 2018, the latest installment appeared in a long-running, sprawling set of conspiracy theories about the FEMA, or Federal Emergency Management Agency, the United States government’s disaster management organization.
Conspiracy theorists have constructed complicated and incoherent claims of a “deep state” plot by globalist federal authorities to build concentration camps for political undesirables (usually presented as conservatives or anti-globalists) by way of FEMA. This has given rise to fevered and baseless reports about “FEMA camps,” disposable coffins, enforced vaccinations, and the related “Jade Helm” conspiracy theory.
In June 2018, adherents continued this tradition with groundless claims about “FEMA barges,” alleging that the federal government was taking advantage of a volcanic eruption in Hawaii to incarcerate civilians in an “internment camp.” On 7 June 2018, the web site SomeonesBones.com — which promotes the extraterrestrial Nibiru and Anunnaki conspiracy theories — wrote:
A flotilla of FEMA barges, each able to hold 2,000 people in cramped conditions, set sail from a secret staging area near San Diego and is currently en route to Hawaii, says a FEMA employee speaking under condition of anonymity. The vessels, he said, departed California on June 5 and, travelling at a speed of 20 knots, will arrive in Hawaii on the eleventh. Rather than berth at Port Allen or Hiwo Harbor, the ships will drop anchor ten miles offshore and use powerboats to ferry displaced persons to one of three FEMA housing ships.
But FEMA is on no mission of mercy; anyone escorted onto a FEMA barge will be incarcerated and transported to a mainland FEMA internment camp in Region IX. There, they will be held captive by a controversial agency with a long history of imprisoning people against their will.
To illustrate this false report, SomeonesBones.com used three images taken out of their proper context. The first does in fact show a FEMA barge, but the photograph was taken in 2017 and shows a vessel deployed by FEMA to provide temporary accommodation to victims of Hurricane Harvey in Texas. The original photograph can be seen in news reports at that time.  
The second image is actually a photograph of the Vernon C. Bain Correctional Center, a prison barge used by the New York City Department of Corrections, which is anchored near the Bronx. The original photograph can be found here. The third image used out of context was actually taken in 2013, not June 2018. It shows a barge docked at Treasure Island in San Francisco. You can see the original photograph here. 
Beyond the fact that SomeonesBones.com has a history of publishing wildly untrue conspiracy theories and misleadingly used unrelated photographs in the context of its story, we could find no corroboration whatsoever for the claim that FEMA plans to even send barges to temporarily house victims of the Kilauea volcanic eruption.
The claim that FEMA plans to use the barges as transport to an “internment camp” is no more than the latest in a long line of groundless conspiracy theories about the agency."

You see, a hurricane is God’s way of saying you are meant to be homeless. So in a sense, your homelessness is a gift from heaven.
The photograph was likely from a 7 May 2015 meeting between Carson and community leaders in Baltimore. But there is no record of Carson making that statement about hurricane victims.
In a September 2017 interview, Carson said that families who receive federal housing assistance would get help in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey, which caused significant damage in parts of Texas:
We will make sure that they’re all taken care of. In many cases where things have been destroyed, we’ll have to go to some transitional housing first. But yes, we’ll be taking care of all of them.
	
		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
Carson has also promised that HUD would be “a rapid, responsible and compassionate agency” in its response.
A HUD spokesperson told us that around 500,000 homeowners affected by Harvey and Hurricane Irma in Florida currently have mortgages insured by the Federal Housing Administration. Those homeowners are eligible for a 90-day “foreclosure moratorium.”
The caption used in the image of Carson could be a play on a remark he actually did make during a May 2017 interview:
I think poverty to a large extent is also a state of mind. You take somebody that has the right mindset, you can take everything from them and put them on the street, and I guarantee in a little while they’ll be right back up there. And you take somebody with the wrong mindset, you can give them everything in the world, they’ll work their way right back down to the bottom.
When asked in September 2015 how he would deal with Hurricane Joaquin, Carson — then a Republican presidential candidate — told reporters, “I don’t know.”"

						Imminent Changes Introduced to Texas Insurance Law in the Midst of Harvey?","On 1 September 2017, a new law will come into force in Texas, making it harder for consumers to get paid for property insurance claims related to weather.","Mixture
					
						
							About this rating","On 27 August 2017, as the full damage to Texas from a storm of historic proportions was not yet fully known, a number of social media posts began to spread, alerting readers to a change in Texas law around insurance claims in the event of weather damage. 
One Facebook user posted the following:
EFFECTIVE FRIDAY, the laws governing insurance claims in Texas will change to your detriment. To take advantage of current law, YOU MUST FILE YOUR CLAIM, IN WRITING, BY THURSDAY, AUGUST 31, regardless of whether your damage occurred before that date. That is, it does not matter if your DAMAGE occurred before the effective date. To take advantage of current law you must actually file a claim by Thursday. It must be (1) IN WRITING, and (2) SPECIFIC ABOUT WHAT DAMAGE YOU ARE CLAIMING OCCURRED.
The changes were made by H.B. 1774. The provisions in that bill hamper your ability to challenge your insurance company if they slow pay, low pay, or deny your claim. (Among other things, It lessens the penalties for their failure to pay your claims or their slow-paying them, and it limits your ability to collect attorneys fees, so you’d have to pay to sue out of your own pocket.) Again, this law makes it harder for you to get the insurance companies to pay what they are supposed to pay when they are supposed to pay it.
Former Texas state representative Glen Maxey wrote:
In the 2017 Legislative Session, a majority of your state lawmakers changed the laws which help property owners recover losses after a storm like Harvey and hampered your ability to hold your insurance company accountable if they slow pay, low pay, or no pay.
Well, the new law goes into effect SEPTEMBER 1!! This law will make it harder for you to get the insurance companies to pay what they are supposed to pay when they are supposed to pay it.
	
		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
And on 29 August, Rep. Joaquín Castro encouraged Texans affected by Tropical Storm Harvey to file their claims before 1 September:

Texans: be sure to file for #Harvey relief before Sept 1. #TXlege passed a bill making it harder to dispute weather-related property claims.
— Joaquin Castro (@JoaquinCastrotx) August 28, 2017

Texas House Bill 1774 does indeed introduce changes to the way property damage insurance claims are dealt with in the state, but only in the event of a litigated dispute over a claim. Most insurance claims are settled out of court, and so the potential benefit in filing a claim before 1 September 2017 (which is itself marginal) will likely not apply in most cases.
The real benefit would be in filing a lawsuit before 1 September, but for obvious practical reasons, it is extremely unlikely that someone whose home has been destroyed or extensively damaged days earlier, would be in a position to do this. 
The law was signed by Governor Greg Abbott on 26 May 2017.
What the law changes
The first major provision in the law is that an individual or business filing a lawsuit in relation to a weather-related property damage insurance claim (including flood damage) will have to give their insurance company 61 days’ notice before initiating litigation.		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
According to an analysis published by the independent House Research Organization in the Texas House of Representatives:
[The law] would require an insured [person] making a claim against an insurer or agent relating to damage to real property caused by an earthquake, earth tremor, wildfire, flood, tornado, lightning, hurricane, hail, wind, snowstorm, or rainstorm to provide written notice to the insurer at least 61 days before filing the claim. This pre-suit notice would have to provide a statement of the acts giving rise to the claim, the specific amount alleged to be owed, and amount of reasonable and necessary attorney’s fees already incurred by the claimant. This notice would be admissible as evidence in a civil action or alternative dispute resolution.
The second major provision in HB 1774 is that it imposes a claim recovery threshold in order for individuals to recover the full amount of their attorney’s fees, if they decide to go to court. If, in the event of a lawsuit, a jury decides to award a plaintiff 80 percent or more of the amount they are claiming, then all that individual’s attorney’s fees will be covered. If a jury decides to award 20 percent or less, none of their attorney’s fees are covered:
The bill would require the court to award the full amount of reasonable and necessary attorney’s fees if the amount to be awarded in the judgment divided by the amount alleged to be owed was at least 0.8, not limited by statute, and recoverable. The court would be prohibited from awarding attorney’s fees if this fraction was less than 0.2, or if the claimant failed to provide pre-suit notice.
We consulted two experts on insurance: Etti Baranoff, an associate professor of finance at Virginia Commonwealth University and a former regulator at the Texas Department of Insurance, and Dalit Baranoff, a historian of insurance policy who runs the Risks and Consequences blog. 
They told us the bill is designed to discourage consumers from taking a claim to court and filing exaggerated claims, but otherwise doesn’t change the process of settling claims out of court. 
HB 1774 should not have any effect on homeowners’ ability to recover claims from insurers. The law has nothing to do with payment of insurance claims. It only applies if a lawsuit is involved. The vast majority of insurance claims will be settled without any dispute. Where it does come into play, is if a policyholder disagrees with an insurance settlement, in which case litigation is still an option.
This is where the 61-day waiting period comes into play, which the Baranoffs say is “meant to encourage mediation and out-of-court settlement”, and the 80/20 rule in the new law will make it harder for people to recoup their legal costs if they decide to sue. The reasoning behind this, according to the Baranoffs, is to discourage inflated or exaggerated claims, since claimants will be less likely to be awarded 80 percent or more of a relatively large claim and are therefore more likely to have to pay some attorney’s fees if they do. 		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
Indeed, the stated purpose of HB 1774 was to stop a historic increase in the number of hailstorm-related property damage insurance claims, something the bill’s sponsor State Representative Greg Bonnen called “the worst lawsuit abuse we have in the state” (Relevant portion begins at 3:50).
Tanya Pierce, Associate Professor of Law at Texas A&M University, previously practiced in the area of complex litigation and insurance coverage. She told us there is only one potential benefit to homeowners in filing a written claim before 1 September 2017:
[Filing a written claim with the insurance company before 1 September] protects them from a small provision of the act that limits the insurance company’s liability on the interest that they would have had to pay as additional damages. 
Again, however, this benefit only accrues if the homeowner later decides to sue the insurance company.
Under current law, Pierce says, an insurance company would have to pay 18 percent interest on whatever they owed in the event that a consumer successfully sues them for a delayed payment. Under the new law, she points out, companies would have to pay a lower rate of interest arrived at by adding 5 percent to the interest rate determined under Sec. 304.003, Financial Code (Sec. 2c). 
So there is a potential benefit in filing a claim before 1 September 2017, but only if you then later file a successful lawsuit in the event of a dispute over your payment. 
Conclusion
The new law will not have a direct effect on insurance claims that are settled out of court, and most insurance claims are settled out of court. However, the law could make it slower and more difficult for homeowners to get paid what they believe they are owed if they start litigation after 1 September 2017. It will also make suing insurance companies more financially risky.
If a consumer were to file a lawsuit against their insurance company before 1 September, they could experience a significant benefit from having done so. However, if their home has been extensively damaged just before 1 September 2017 (by historically catastrophic flooding, for example), it is extremely unlikely they would be able, practically speaking, to find and hire an attorney and file a suit before 1 September. 
They would also have to have a reasonable basis to sue — a dispute over their claim, or an insurance company’s refusal to pay, for example — a process that there simply wasn’t time for between the arrival of Tropical Storm Harvey on 26 August and the enactment of the new law on 1 September.
The only potential benefit from filing a claim before 1 September is that if someone later decides to sue the insurance company and wins, the company will be obliged to pay them the higher, pre-September rate of interest on what they owe. 
The claims contained in viral Facebook posts on 27 August 2017 are a largely accurate description of the provisions of HB 1774, but they do lack important context and do not make it clear to readers that the law only affects how claims are dealt with in the event that someone decides to sue an insurance company. These posts do not include that most insurance claims are settled out of court, and will therefore not be directly affected by the change in the law."

						Does a Video Show Two Men Looting a Cash Register During Tropical Storm Harvey?",A video shows two men looting a cash register during Tropical Storm Harvey in Texas.,"Unproven
					
						
							About this rating","On 29 August 2017, an anonymous Internet user posted a video to the viral video sharing website LiveLeak, labeling it with the headline, “Couple of sh*theads looting in Houston during Hurricane Harvey.” The video purports to show two men looting in Houston amid flooding from the catastrophic storm which made landfall in southeast Texas in late August 2017.
The video shows two men standing in thigh-deep water, taking what appears to be cash from a register. The grainy video contains no time or location stamp, and the poor quality makes it difficult to ascertain what kind of currency they are taking out of the register. There is also no sound, and it is unclear if a crime is taking place — or if they work at the store and are salvaging money amid a flood. Whether they had a key or if they broke in to the register would also be telling, but the video is edited in such a way that it doesn’t show that information:


	
		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
Because this video lacks any time or location information, we are unable to verify where it took place and when, and under what circumstances.
Kese Smith, spokesman for the Houston Police Department, told us the city has experienced “almost non-existent” looting in the aftermath of the storm — with a population of 2.3 million people and ranking the fourth largest city, population-wise, in the United States, there have only been 18 arrests for looting since Harvey hit. (The Houston Chronicle tallied 40 arrests for Harris County as a whole as of 31 August 2017.) The storm also brought catastrophic flooding and 46 deaths as of 1 September 2017. On 29 August 2017, Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner implemented an overnight curfew, “only to prevent potential criminal acts.”
Smith told us police could not verify a video with no location or timestamps, but in general Houston residents have been law-abiding and helpful:
Looting is almost non existent in Houston. People have been cooperative not just with each other, but also with Houston PD. The weather is at its worst but Houstonians are at their best.
The same day it was posted on LiveLeak, the video was posted to the popular “Outlaw Morgan” Facebook page with the caption, “So the looting has begun.”
Despite the fact the video’s date, location and circumstances are all completely unknown, that has not stopped the outrage machine; it has been viewed millions of times and shared thousands of times, and also has numerous comments with racist messages and even violent death threats aimed at the black community as a result."

							About this rating","One of the more persistent types of racial hoaxes are misleading claims on social media that people of color loot property during various natural disasters.
One such hoax about Hurricane Dorian, which threatened the Southeast coastal region of the U.S. in late August and early September 2019, was perpetuated by a Facebook user on Aug. 30, 2019. The user used the disaster as an opportunity to post images of non-white people carrying boxes on sidewalks and across streets and claiming they were Floridians looting property as residents and business owners evacuated ahead of the storm.
But none of the images was taken during Dorian, nor were they taken in Florida or even taken in the same year as Dorian.

A Reuters photographer took the picture, which carried captions that said the people pictured were stealing from an electronics store.
The second photograph (bottom left) was taken almost three decades ago. According to the caption, it was taken in April 1992 during the Los Angeles riots, which resulted from the acquittal of four white police officers who were captured on video beating black motorist Rodney King. The caption on the photograph states that those pictured were taking stolen electronics in boxes across a street.
The final image appears to be a screen capture from a video taken by bystanders during Hurricane Harvey, which hit Texas in 2017. Although the purpose of the Facebook post appears to be to make it look like non-white people are predisposed to commit crimes of opportunity like looting, overall crime during Harvey actually dropped, according to Houston police Chief Art Acevedo.
Acevedo told the local NPR station, “There’s this idea that crime is always going to follow storms, and that is frankly — according to most research — not really true. In fact, what most researchers actually say is that there’s this certain sense of goodwill and altruism in communities that actually helps deter violence and other crimes in the wake of these things.”"

						Red Cross Instructed to Throw Away Donated Supplies in Texas?","In the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey, the Red Cross was instructed to throw away a significant quantity of supplies that had been donated by the public.","Unproven
					
						
							About this rating","On 10 September 2017, a now-viral video posted to Facebook by Wendy Wilkerson Underwood contained claims that the Red Cross in Houston, Texas was instructed to throw out a significant quantity of food and supplies donated by the public in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey: 
Have you seen the posts about the Red Cross and their abuse of volunteers and evacuees? Well, this is going to blow you away! They are throwing supplies into the trash in Houston. But don’t worry, they said they can collect more from what’s going on in Florida. I’m glad they are so respectful of their donors hard earned money.

In the video, the camera pans over a pile of food, bags, and crates in what appears to be a garage, while the woman narrating it reiterates that it consisted of donations to the organization that had been discarded. No additional information is given. According to the person who narrated the video, the director of the Red Cross in Houston said this was done “because they can get more for Florida.” The narrator also says that that the items shown in the video include 600 brand new, donated blankets and 500 pounds of dog food.
But Red Cross spokesperson Elizabeth Penniman denied in a statement that any such order had been given:
We work with a large number of partners, who provide bulk donations of goods to the Red Cross. There has been no directive given at any of our operations to discard or dispose of any new donated items such as canned food, water, diapers, blankets or dog food.
	
		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
Penniman added that the organization had attempted to contact Underwood:
Numerous inquiries to Ms. Underwood, who originally posted this video, have gone unanswered. These inquiries have come from both the local Red Cross staff on the ground in Texas, the Disaster Response Operation in Texas, and from Red Cross National Headquarters in Washington, DC. It is important to note that these videos seem to have been filmed in Ms. Underwood’s garage in Waco, Texas, nearly 200 miles — or a three-hour drive — from our primary warehousing operations in Houston. We have asked Ms. Underwood if she was on the ground at any one of our Red Cross shelters or warehousing facilities; we have asked her to open these closed plastic bags to show us what is in them, and we have asked her to identify the “Red Cross Director” she cites. She has not done so.
The Red Cross also released a lengthy statement about the matter (although without directly addressing these specific claims):

The Dangers of Rumors and Misinformation
Today there are roughly 6,000 American Red Cross volunteers on the ground in 13 states and U.S. territories whose sole purpose is to help their neighbors. These 6,000 volunteers are helping thousands they’ve never met, who have been devastated by Hurricanes Irma and Harvey, as well as thousands more threatened by wildfires across the West and Northwest. In too many cases to count, our volunteers have set aside family and professional obligations to put our humanitarian mission first and lend a hand.
While these volunteers work tirelessly to deliver much-needed aid to areas decimated by unprecedented disaster events, the American Red Cross is faced with an onslaught of baseless claims, rumors or outright lies that do nothing more than undermine our critical relief efforts.
On this page, we embrace the exchange of different ideas and points of view. And during times of disaster, we know that emotions run high and misinformation is quick to spread. But these accusations (theft, charging for services, denying assistance) not only derail the efforts of so many workers providing aid, they divert resources away from our core mission: to deliver relief. The countless hours spent addressing malicious falsehoods ultimately risk hurting those we’re trying to serve.
So for those of you who doubt our credibility, we have one thing to say to you: Join us. Sign up. Put on a Red Cross vest and volunteer at one of our shelters, blood drives or events. We welcome your service.
For those with complaints, provide specifics so that we may follow up to ensure our services are adequately meeting needs and measuring up to the standards we expect and communities deserve. We take legitimate criticisms seriously.
But for those of you determined to perpetuate hatred, rumors, misinformation or lies, you’ll have to excuse us for not addressing you, as we’ve got important work to do to provide help to those in need.
The organization does sometimes discard items that have been donated, but there is no evidence that it does so indiscriminately or on a large scale, and it only throws out supplies that are unusable for one reason or another, according to Penniman:
With donations of food — whether for those in our shelters, or for pets that might be sheltering with their owners, we have policies and procedures in place to protect the health for all concerned. Very often, we receive an overwhelming amount of donated food to our disaster operations, as well as donations of pet food. As we cannot ensure the safety of food prepared in non-commercial settings, we do not accept home-cooked food as donations. In the case of donated pet food, we cannot accept opened bags of food. Even properly prepared food, if not clearly monitored or packaged, can quickly go bad through no fault of those who prepared or are serving it.		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
While it remains unclear whether these were actually discarded donations or just a pile of somebody’s storm-damaged possessions in a garage, a 2016 CBS report highlights the fact that many well-intentioned charitable contributions are of no use to disaster relief efforts and are often thrown away as a result:


However, the Red Cross has come under scrutiny in the past for alleged mismanagement of donations and funds. Investigative news outlet ProPublica has a whole series on the nonprofit organization and how it has spent its money after disasters."

This picture was actually taken in June 2016 (more than a year before Hurricane Harvey), after thousands of homes were evacuated in Brazoria County, Texas, due to a severe flood. In an attempt to protect his home, local resident Randy Wagner purchased an “Aqua Dam” and installed it around his property, as a local television station reported at the time:

Of the thousands of homes evacuated and damaged by flooding in Brazoria County, one family’s home is high and dry on West FM 1462 in Rosharon.
Randy Wagner decided to take a chance on something called an Aqua Dam, a product he discovered online.
The product in question is not “inflatable” in the sense that it is filled with air; rather, the AquaDam encloses water:

<img loading=""lazy"" class=""aligncenter wp-image-102449"" style=""border: 1px solid black;"" src=""https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/08/aquadam.jpg"" alt="""" width=""600"" height=""257"" data-recalc-dims=""1"" srcset=""https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/08/aquadam.jpg?resize=1000%2C429&amp;zoom=1 1000w, https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/08/aquadam.jpg?resize=1000%2C429&amp;zoom=0.5 500w, https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/08/aquadam.jpg?resize=1000%2C429&amp;zoom=0.25 250w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"" />
He filled up 400 feet of 30 inch high tubes made of plastic and fabric with water.
“I was the crazy guy. Everybody was kinda going by, laughing at me. But today they are really impressed with this AquaDam,” said Wagner.
He and his family stayed, waited and watched as the water rose to 27 inches, but never seeped through the barriers. The product cost him money, but he told KHOU 11 News it was well worth his sanity.
“$8,300 is to me a small investment on a house that could have two feet of water in it and cost me $150,000 in repairs.” he said.
Here’s a video report from USA Today about Wagner and his house-saving AquaDam:"

							About this rating","In September 2017, a viral rumor spread on Facebook, reporting that the waters in southeast Texas had tested positive for a variety of potentially harmful contaminants and diseases. 
The message typically read:

DISEASE WARNING:
I just got a call from a Southeast Texas disaster relief group (I was in direct contact with them and a few other groups assisting with rescues via phone).
They’re spreading the word that the water in all areas (Beaumont, Vidor, Port Arthur, Orange, Lumberton, Bridge City, etc.) has tested positive for MRSA, Typhoid Fever, flesh eating bacteria, sewage, and toxic chemicals.
If you or anyone you know were participating in rescues, or were in the water with open wounds, and start experiencing signs of illness, get to a hospital immediately for vaccination and antibiotics. They’re already getting reports of people becoming violently ill.
We contacted officials in various local authorities in the cities and counties specified in the Facebook post, and none were familiar with any tests being conducted for the contaminants and diseases listed. On 5 September, the city of Beaumont’s public health department issued a statement in response to the rumor:
There have been rumors that people in our area have tested positive for MRSA, Typhoid Fever, flesh eating bacteria, sewage and toxic chemicals. These conditions are required by law to be reported to the Health Department. Currently, we have no reports. The Health Department would like to take this opportunity to remind physicians, hospitals, and laboratories that these conditions are required to be reported to the local health authority.
A spokesperson for the Texas Department of State Health Services also told us that the department was not familiar with any test results indicating the presence of MRSA (bacteria that can cause skin infections and sepsis) or typhoid fever. 
We’re conducting disease surveillance in the shelters and haven’t gotten any reports of MRSA or typhoid fever cases related to Harvey from shelters or otherwise. Both of those illnesses are required by law to be reported in Texas.
The spokesperson warned, however, that the public should avoid entering floodwaters, if possible:
That said, there’s no question that flooding raises concerns about bacterial and chemical contamination, and that’s why we recommend people avoid contact direct with the water as much as possible. Anyone with an open wound that comes into contact with floodwater should wash it promptly with soap and clean water and should watch for signs of an infection (swelling, pain, discoloration, blisters) and seek medical attention if they think the wound has become infected.
Similarly, an 11 September 2017 statement by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality warned about the potential dangers presented by floodwaters:
Floodwaters contain many hazards, including bacteria and other contaminants. Precautions should be taken by anyone involved in cleanup activities or any others who may be exposed to flood waters. These precautions include heeding all warnings from local and state authorities regarding safety advisories. In addition to the drowning hazards of wading, swimming, or driving in swift floodwaters, these waters can carry large objects that are not always readily visible that can cause injuries to those in the water. Other potential hazards include downed power lines and possible injuries inflicted by animals displaced by the floodwaters. 
There is no evidence of floodwaters in southeast Texas testing positive for the diseases and contaminants claimed in the viral Facebook post, and the local and state officials we contacted did not express any familiarity with any such testing.
Although there is no evidence that floodwaters in southeast Texas have tested positive for the diseases and contaminants claimed in the Facebook post, that doesn’t mean that future testing won’t reveal such a contamination — or that the floodwater is safe. 
We know from testing organized by CNN and the New York Times that floodwaters in the Houston area have tested positive for exceptionally high levels of E. coli and sewage contamination.
Houston is around 100 miles from the locations mentioned in the viral Facebook post."

							About this rating","In December 2018, claims emerged that a speech pathologist had lost her job working with elementary school children in Austin, Texas, simply because she refused to sign an oath not to boycott Israel, as reported by The Intercept‘s Glenn Greenwald:

A children’s speech pathologist who has worked for the last nine years with developmentally disabled, autistic, and speech-impaired elementary school students in Austin, Texas, has been told that she can no longer work with the public school district, after she refused to sign an oath vowing that she “does not” and “will not” engage in a boycott of Israel or “otherwise tak[e] any action that is intended to inflict economic harm” on that foreign nation …
[Bahia] Amawi began working in 2009 on a contract basis with the Pflugerville Independent School District, which includes Austin, to provide assessments and support for school children from the county’s growing Arabic-speaking immigrant community. The children with whom she has worked span the ages of 3 to 11. Ever since her work for the school district began in 2009, her contract was renewed each year with no controversy or problem.
But this year, all of that changed. On August 13, the school district once again offered to extend her contract for another year by sending her essentially the same contract and set of certifications she has received and signed at the end of each year since 2009.
She was prepared to sign her contract renewal until she noticed one new, and extremely significant, addition: a certification she was required to sign pledging that she “does not currently boycott Israel,” that she “will not boycott Israel during the term of the contract,” and that she shall refrain from any action “that is intended to penalize, inflict economic harm on, or limit commercial relations with Israel, or with a person or entity doing business in Israeli or in an Israel-controlled territory” …
The anti-BDS [boycott, divestment and sanctions] Israel oath was included in Amawi’s contract papers due to an Israel-specific state law enacted on May 2, 2017, by the Texas State Legislature and signed into law two days later by GOP Gov. Greg Abbott. The bill unanimously passed the lower House by a vote of 131-0, and then the Senate by a vote of 25-4.

Greenwald’s article (and a widely-shared Facebook video which accompanied it) prompted numerous reader inquiries about whether Texas law really does require public contractors to make such commitments not to “boycott Israel”:

	
		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
The story was subsequently picked up by several local and national news outlets.
The Intercept‘s article accurately reflected a law signed by Texas governor Greg Abbott in 2017, which did require any and all government agencies and bodies to demand that would-be contractors sign a commitment not to boycott Israel as a prerequisite to entering into a contract with them.
In October 2017, we examined similar reports in the context of recovery and repair efforts after Hurricane Harvey, finding that the city of Dickinson, Texas, had indeed been forced by the statewide law to require anyone applying for a repair grant to swear that they did not and would not engage in a boycott of Israel.
Bahia Amawi, as a would-be contractor providing speech pathology services to the Pflugerville Independent School District (a public body), was asked to sign such an oath in September 2018, and according to her lawsuit, when she declined as a matter of conscience, her contract renewal could not be completed.
In May 2017, Governor Greg Abbott signed the law in question (House Bill 89), which came into effect in September of that year. The law stated that:

A governmental entity may not enter into a contract with a company for goods or services unless the contract contains a written verification from the company that it:
Does not boycott Israel; and
will not boycott Israel during the term of the contract.
Under the law, “company” is defined as including a “sole proprietorship,” such as that conducted by Amawi and other individual contractors offering and providing professional services.
Amawi is suing the Pflugerville Independent School District and Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton in federal court, arguing that H.B. 89 is a violation of the constitutional right to free speech, given that it requires a commitment not to engage in or advocate for a boycott, thereby suppressing only one side of an ongoing political debate in what Amawi’s lawsuit argues is an unconstitutional manner.
Amawi has asked the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas to declare the “no boycott of Israel” law unconstitutional and unenforcable, order the school district to remove that section from her contract agreement, and declare all similar clauses in other public sector contracts null and void.
Her court filings included a copy of the contract offered to her, including the following section, which requires the commitment not to engage in a boycott of Israel:

Pursuant to Section 2270.001 of Texas Government Code, the Contractor affirms that it:
1. Does not currently boycott Israel; and 2. Will not boycott Israel during the term of the contract.
Pursuant to Section 2270.001 of Texas Government Code:
1. “Boycott Israel” means refusing to deal with, terminating business activities with, or otherwise taking any action that is intended to penalize, inflict economic harm on, or limit commercial relations specifically with Israel, or with a person or entity doing business in Israel or in an Israeli-controlled territory, but does not include an action made for ordinary business purposes…"

						Texas Accepts Mexican Offer of Hurricane Harvey Aid",null,null,"In late August 2017, after Harvey slammed into Texas as a category 4 hurricane, dumping a record amount of rain onto the region and causing catastrophic flooding, the Mexican government offered to help relief efforts in Texas.
On 30 August 2017, both Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) and the U.S. State Department said that they would take Mexico up on its offer. Abbott told media outlets:
We had a list of aid and assistance that they have offered to provide that we are accepting.
The State Department posted footage of remarks by Secretary of State Rex Tillerson after meeting with Mexican Foreign Affairs Secretary Luis Videgaray Caso. Tillerson said:
I want to thank the Mexican government for its offer of assistance to the state of Texas. They have offered a wide range of assistance, coordinating with the governor down in Texas and also through FEMA. It was very generous of Mexico to offer their help at a very, very challenging time for our citizens back in Texas and now moving toward the border with Louisiana as we’re watching.
	
		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
Videgaray replied:
You’re absolutely welcome. We are here to help. We are friends. We are neighbors. We are friends, and that’s what friends do.
However, on 11 September 2017, his department said in a statement that the Mexican government would not be able to provide assistance, on account of the damage done in the country by an earthquake measuring 8.2 four days earlier. 
The quake caused damage in three states, killed 95 people and injuring hundreds more. According to the statement:
Under these circumstances, the Mexican government will channel all available logistical support toward helping the families and communities affected in the country, which is why the government in Texas and the U.S. federal government have been informed that, unfortunately, at this time it will not be possible to provide the help originally offered to Texas to help with the damages caused by hurricane Harvey at the end of August. 
Videgaray first announced his country’s intention to help in two Twitter posts on 27 August 2017. He posted in Spanish and in English:
I just spoke to Gov. @GregAbbott_TX. We will provide all the help we can. Our full solidarity with the people of Texas. #HurricaneHarvey
He also stated that he spoke to Abbott, adding in Spanish, “We will identify specific aid that we can provide.”		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
Videgaray’s department reiterated its offer in a statement that also criticized U.S. President Donald Trump for continuing to insist on his Twitter account that Mexico would pay for the construction of a “wall” between the two countries:
Mexico will not negotiate NAFTA, nor any other aspect of the bilateral relationship, through social media or any other news platform.
The Mexican government takes this opportunity to express its full solidarity with the people and government of the United States as a result of the damages caused by Hurricane Harvey in Texas, and expresses that it has offered to provide help and cooperation to the US government in order to deal with the impact of this natural disaster —as good neighbors should always do in trying times.
Undersecretary for North America Carlos Manuel Sada Solana also said that Abbott was contacted directly and “immediately accepted” Mexico’s offer of assistance, though Abbott did not initially confirm that. 
According to Sada, Abbott had agreed to send a list to his government detailing the aid they will need:
I got the impression that the governor is also evaluating how Mexico’s help can be more efficient and more useful.
Mexican consulate officials had reportedly been in contact with Abbott’s office regarding Mexico’s offer and said that the country was prepared to offer “a Katrina-like assistance package.”
In 2005, Mexico sent 200 troops and 45 military vehicles to Texas to help victims of Hurricane Katrina. Their efforts resulted in the distribution of more than 184,000 tons of supplies, as well as hundreds of medical consultations and a reported 170,000 prepared meals. Mexico also sent aid for victims of Hurricane Sandy, and regularly sends a crew of bomberos — considered among the best in the world — to provide aid fighting major wildfires and to help with environmental concerns.
Attempts to contact Francisco de la Torre Galindo, the Mexican consul in Dallas, were unsuccessful. We also contacted Abbott’s office and the State Department, but have yet to receive a response."

Joel Osteen was the subject of harsh criticism in the wake of Hurricane Harvey as his church did not offer immediately shelter to flood victims in the aftermath of the storm.

							About this rating","Hurricane Irma was the second major hurricane of the 2017 Atlantic hurricane season (after Hurricane Harvey), and the storm brought with it dire predictions that prompted mass evacuations, widespread preparedness activity, and strongly-worded warnings:
Whether it will actually endure a storm of that size and violence isn’t clear. As of Friday morning, Hurricane Irma, one of the strongest hurricanes ever measured in the Atlantic Ocean, was predicted to tear through South Florida and up the center of the state. If forecasts hold, it could be the most ferocious storm seen in the Sunshine State since Hurricane Andrew cut east-to-west across its peninsula a quarter-century ago.
“Irma has me sick to my stomach,” said Eric Blake, a scientist with the National Hurricane Center, on his personal Twitter account on Thursday evening. “This hurricane is as serious as any I have seen. No hype, just the hard facts. Take every lifesaving precaution you can.”
“I have little doubt Irma will go down as one of the most infamous in Atlantic hurricane history,” he added.
As is typically the case with events that can produce widespread damage and destruction, news about Hurricane Irma has been peppered with misinformation, hoaxes, and images of dubious veracity, prompting us to compile some of the most frequently asked reader questions about that potentially devastating weather phenomenon:

Q: Did FEMA push through a law forcing all hotels and motels to accept all pets during hurricane evacuations?
A: No. Disabled persons who utilize service animals are excluded from hotel and motel “pet policies” under the Americans with Disabilities Act, but that policy applies irrespective of weather conditions. More information about this claim is available here.
	
		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
Q: Is the dishwasher a good place to store valuables during a hurricane?
A: The short answer is no, a dishwasher is not an especially safe place in which to secure valuables and keepsakes during a hurricane. The longer answer is available here.
Q: Did airlines begin price-gouging evacuees as Irma approached?
A: Online listings for some airlines initially showed very high prices for flights out of Florida during the approach of Hurricane Irma, but some airlines also later instituted price caps to ensure reasonable and affordable fares for those needing to get out of the state before the storm.
Q: Does a popular video depict Hurricane Irma battering Antigua and Barbuda?
A: No, the storm footage seen in a widely circulated video was actually captured in Uruguay in 2016.
Q: Did Hurricane Irma pick up “sharks” as it developed?
A: A: No. A news chyron seemingly reporting this information was in fact the product of a build-your-own-prank site.		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
Q: Did the governor of the Virgin Islands empower the National Guard to seize weapons and other property in response to Irma?
A: Governor Kenneth Mapp did issue an executive order that does authorize the National Guard to seize firearms and other property if he deems it necessary to keep public order.
Q: Did the 2005 film Category 7: The End of the World feature hurricanes named Harvey and Irma, revealing a conspiracy of weather manipulation?
A: No. The details claimed about that movie in a popular viral rumor were all inaccurate.
Q: Is Hurricane Irma the first “Category 6” storm?
A: No, Despite some putative discussion on the subject, the classification of a Category 6 storm does not exist.
Q: Did right-wing talk radio host Rush Limbaugh call Irma a “liberal hoax,” and then quietly evacuate Florida himself?
No. As the Washington Post reported in an article critical of Limbaugh, the talk radio host accused the news media of exaggerating weather-related dangers but did not suggest Hurricane Irma itself was a hoax.		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
Q: Did 1,000 people die in Barbuda from Hurricane Irma?
A: No. As of 7 September 2017, Irma’s death toll was 10 (after the storm made landfall in Barbuda).

CANNOT FIND, 393048
People have begun resharing hurricane rita evacuation gridlock from 2005 as current conditions heading out of Florida for Irma evacuation. Screenshot uploaded. Can you run a post asap? thank you!
Just heard that Trump set up ID checks at the border between Georgia and Florida to “catch” any illegal immigrants who are trying to flee Irma… and in the process slowing everyone on the road from getting to safety.

Any truth to this? And, if so, why isn’t anyone covering it?
can you verify if Florida Governor Scott said that workers cannot be fired for staying with their family during Hurricane Irma. That an employer cannot fire you if you stay home. I have heard it from several people.
Was Trump’s Cariabbean property destroyed because of Hurricane Irma.

This content is shared here because the topic may interest Snopes readers; it does not, however, represent the work of Snopes fact-checkers or editors.","ISTANBUL (AP) — A man who previously traveled with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s entourage to the United States entered the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul just before writer Jamal Khashoggi vanished there, according to images published Thursday by a pro-government Turkish newspaper.
The Sabah newspaper’s report showed the man also later outside the Saudi consul general’s home, checking out of a Turkish hotel as a large suitcase stood by his side, and leaving Turkey on Oct. 2.
The report came as Turkish crime-scene investigators finished an overnight search of both the consul general’s residence and a second search of the consulate itself amid Ankara’s fears that Saudi authorities had Khashoggi killed and dismembered inside the diplomatic mission in Istanbul.
Saudi Arabia, which initially called the allegations “baseless,” has not responded to repeated requests for comment from The Associated Press over recent days, including on Thursday.
The Sabah report showed the man walking past police barricades at the consulate at 9:55 a.m. with several men trailing behind him. Khashoggi arrived at the consulate several hours later at 1:14 p.m., then disappeared while his fiancée waited outside for him.
	
		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
A report Wednesday by the pro-government newspaper Yeni Safak, citing what it described as an audio recording of Khashoggi’s slaying, said a Saudi team immediately accosted the 60-year-old journalist after he entered the consulate, cutting off his fingers and later decapitating him.
Previously leaked surveillance footage showed consular vehicles moving from the consulate to the consul general’s official residence, some 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) away, a little under two hours after Khashoggi walked inside. The Sabah newspaper showed an image of the man at 4:53 p.m. at the consul’s home, then at 5:15 p.m. checking out of a hotel. He later cleared airport security at 5:58 p.m.
Security services in Turkey have used pro-government media to leak details of Khashoggi’s case, adding to the pressure on the kingdom.
The AP could not immediately verify the man’s identity, though he’s one of the individuals previously identified by Turkish authorities as being involved in the 15-man Saudi team that targeted Khashoggi.
Images shot by the Houston Chronicle and later distributed by the AP show the same man was in Prince Mohammed’s entourage when he visited a Houston subdivision in April to see rebuilding efforts after Hurricane Harvey. The same man wore lapel pins, including one of the flags of Saudi Arabia and America intertwined, that other bodyguards accompanying Prince Mohammed wore on the trip.
The three-week trip across the U.S. saw Prince Mohammed meet with business leaders and celebrities, including Amazon billionaire Jeff Bezos, who now owns the Post.
The searches and the leaks in Turkish media have ensured the world’s attention remains focused on what happened to Khashoggi, a Washington Post columnist who went into a self-imposed exile in the United States over the rise of Prince Mohammed. It also put further strains on the relationship between the kingdom, the world’s largest oil exporter, and its main security guarantor, the U.S., as tensions with Iran and elsewhere in the Middle East remain high.
Flying back home after a visit to both Saudi Arabia and Turkey, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo remained positive Wednesday about an ongoing Saudi probe into Khashoggi’s disappearance, but he stressed that answers are needed.		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
“Sooner’s better than later for everyone,” Pompeo said.
President Donald Trump, who initially came out hard on the Saudis over the disappearance but since has backed off, said Wednesday that the U.S. wanted Turkey to turn over any audio or video recording it had of Khashoggi’s alleged killing “if it exists.”
On Thursday, the Post published what it described as Khashoggi’s last column in honor of the missing journalist.
In it, Khashoggi pointed to the muted international response to ongoing abuses against journalists by governments in the Middle East.
“As a result, Arab governments have been given free rein to continue silencing the media at an increasing rate,” Khashoggi wrote. He added: “The Arab world is facing its own version of an Iron Curtain, imposed not by external actors but through domestic forces vying for power.”

This content is shared here because the topic may interest Snopes readers; it does not, however, represent the work of Snopes fact-checkers or editors.","WASHINGTON (AP) — After Hurricane Maria damaged tens of thousands of homes in Puerto Rico, a newly created Florida company with an unproven record won more than $30 million in contracts from the Federal Emergency Management Agency to provide emergency tarps and plastic sheeting for repairs.
Bronze Star LLC never delivered those urgently needed supplies, which even months later remain in demand by hurricane victims on the island.
According to an exclusive Associated Press report, FEMA eventually terminated the contracts, without paying any money, and re-started the process this month to supply more tarps for the island. The earlier effort took nearly four weeks from the day FEMA awarded the contracts to Bronze Star and the day it canceled them.
Thousands of Puerto Ricans remain homeless, and many complain that the federal government is taking too long to install tarps. The U.S. territory has been hit by severe rainstorms in recent weeks that have caused widespread flooding.
It is not clear how thoroughly FEMA investigated Bronze Star or its ability to fulfill the contracts. Formed by two brothers in August, Bronze Star had never before won a government contract or delivered tarps or plastic sheeting. The address listed for the business is a single-family home in a residential subdivision in St. Cloud, Florida.
	
		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
One of the brothers, Kayon Jones, said manufacturers he contacted before bidding on the contracts assured him they could provide the tarps but later said they could not meet the government’s requirements. Jones said supplying the materials was problematic because most of the raw materials came out of Houston, which was hit hard by Hurricane Harvey. He said he sought a waiver from FEMA to allow him to order tarps from a Chinese manufacturer and for more time, but FEMA denied the request.
FEMA canceled the contracts Nov. 6, Jones said. The government notified his brother and him a few days later that it would seek $9.3 million in damages unless they signed a waiver releasing the U.S. from any liability. The brothers agreed.
“We were trying to help; it wasn’t about making money or anything like that,” Jones said.
FEMA awarded the company two contracts Oct. 10 to provide 500,000 tarps and 60,000 rolls of plastic sheeting. More than a half dozen others also bid, but FEMA said it could not provide details about their bids.
“The award of a government contract to a company with absolutely no experience in producing the materials sought obviously raises very bright red flags,” said Dan Feldman, professor of public management at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice at City University of New York. “I would hope and assume that the inspector general for the Department of Homeland Security would begin immediately to take a very hard look at this process.”
A FEMA spokesman, Ron Roth, said the agency’s review process was “somewhat expedited” after Hurricane Maria to respond as quickly as possible to the emergency. But he said the agency did perform its due diligence.
“Submissions from potential contractors are objectively evaluated, and a contract is awarded based on the highest-rated submission,” Roth said.
Such “best value” competitive solicitations take into account past performance and a contractor’s ability to deliver as well as price, said Alan Miller, an attorney who spent 22-years advising federal contracting officials until retiring last year.		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
“In every circumstance, regardless of the award, whether it’s $400 to the local stationery company for envelopes, or it’s $400 million for a construction contract, the contracting officer is required to make a responsibility determination,” Miller said. “Does this company have the infrastructure; do they have the inventory processes, the production processes, the financial capability, for performing the work?”
Nine bids were received on the first contract for plastic sheeting and eight bids on the second contract for tarps. Roth said Star was determined to be the most qualified.
“FEMA’s initial technical evaluation determined Bronze Star could do the jobs based on their proposals, which confirmed that they could meet the product specifications and delivery dates,” he said.
Kayon Jones, the co-owner of Bronze Star, served in the U.S. Navy from 1997 to 2000, finishing his duty as a seaman storekeeper on the USS Gettysburg, a guided missile cruiser. The contract solicitation gave preference to veteran-owned companies. According to Navy records, Jones was never awarded a Bronze Star, a medal earned by service members who serve heroically in combat.
In an interview, Jones told The Associated Press he picked the name because he has another company with the word star in it. He said his brother, who is also listed on state incorporation documents for the business, served in the Army and is disabled. Army records show Jones’ brother also didn’t receive a Bronze Star, and it provided no evidence of a service-related injury. Richard Jones did not respond to multiple calls and requests through his brother for comment.
“My brother and I, we are both veterans, so we just came up with a name to do business,” Kayon Jones said. “We’re not saying we have a Bronze Star or anything.”
The day after FEMA canceled the Bronze Star contract, it awarded a contract to OSC Solutions Inc. for plastic sheeting for Hurricane Maria victims. The West Palm Beach, Florida-based company has roughly two decades of federal contracting experience and has produced such supplies multiple times.
The FEMA spokesman, Roth, acknowledged the contract problems delayed delivery of tarps to Puerto Rico but said anyone who needs a tarp should now be able to get one.		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
More than 93,000 tarps have been sent to distribution centers on the island and now are available to cover homes, Roth said. The Army Corps of Engineers’ “Blue Roof” program has provided 11,000 more reinforced tarps installed on homes by contractors.
To date, roughly $88 million in federal money has been awarded to four contractors, including Bronze Star, for tents and tarps, records show. The rescinded contracts with Bronze Star account for 35 percent of the total.
Michael Byrne, Puerto Rico’s FEMA coordination officer, estimated that at least 60,000 blue roofs are needed across the island. About 350 are installed each day, though he said that is expected to increase.
“One of the limiting factors is the availability of the material,” Byrne said.

						Are Hotels Required to Accept Pets During Natural Disasters?","The federal government, either through the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) or the 2006 PETS law allows pet owners to bring their pets to any hotel or motel during weather-related evacuations.","Mostly False
					
						
							About this rating","In late August and early September 2017, the approach of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma prompted social media claims that the federal government, either through a 2006 law or through the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), mandated that pets be allowed to accompany disaster evacuees into hotels and motels.
A typical expression of the claim read:
ATTENTION: If you are evacuating to a hotel/motel and they say they DON’T accept pets, don’t get ugly, but simply tell them that is against the law & FEMA established that after Hurricane Katrina!
The Pets Evacuation and Transportation Standards Act (PETS) was a bi-partisan initiative in the United States House of Representatives to require states seeking Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) assistance to accommodate pets and service animals in their plans for evacuating residents facing disasters.
DONT SHARE, COPY AND PASTE SO MORE PEOPLE READ THIS!”
The Pets Evacuation and Transportation Standards Act of 2006 essentially requires that FEMA take into account the needs of pet owners when developing disaster preparedness plans, and it also authorizes the director of the agency to fund emergency shelter facilities which can accommodate displaced persons with pets and service animals, but it makes no mention of requirements placed on hotels or motels:
Pets Evacuation and Transportation Standards Act of 2006
Amends the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act to require the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to ensure that state and local emergency preparedness operational plans address the needs of individuals with household pets and service animals prior to, during, and following a major disaster or emergency.
Authorizes the Director to: (1) study and develop plans that take into account the needs of individuals with pets and service animals prior to, during, and following a major disaster or emergency; and (2) make financial contributions, on the basis of programs or projects approved by the Director, to the states and local authorities for animal emergency preparedness purposes, including the procurement, construction, leasing, or renovating of emergency shelter facilities and materials that will accommodate people with pets and service animals.
Authorizes federal agencies to provide, as assistance essential to meeting threats to life and property resulting from a major disaster, rescue, care, shelter, and essential needs to individuals with household pets and service animals and to such pets and animals.
	
		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
The “Rumors” section of FEMA’s website now specifically addresses this issue and notes that the rumor about hotels and motels being legally required to accommodate pets is false:
There are reports that hotels and motels participating in the Transitional Sheltering Assistance Program are legally required to accommodate pets. This is FALSE. (September 8)
Hotels and motels participating in FEMA’s Transitional Sheltering Assistance Program do not fall under the Pets Evacuation and Transportation Standards (PETS) Act (Pub. L. 109-308 (2006)). Please call the hotel before you go and ask if pets are permitted.
Hotels must accept service animals and individuals with access and functional needs should check with the hotel to ensure if accessible lodging accommodations are available to meet their needs.
In preparation for Tropical Storm Irene, FEMA advised pet owners to “locate several ‘pet-friendly’ hotels” but made no mention of any purported requirement for all hotels to accommodate pets:
Planning for animal evacuation:

If you must leave your residence, have a plan for your family pets;
Go online and locate several “pet-friendly” hotels in and out of your area;
Identify friends or relatives outside your area where you and your pets can stay;
If there is a disaster pending, evacuate early with your pets, working animals and livestock; don’t wait for a mandatory evacuation order; and
Animals should have leg bands or tattoos, microchips or identification tags with their name as well as your address and phone number.


FEMA’s other guides for pet owners also make no mention of the purported requirement.
However, disabled people who use service animals do have the law on their side when they check into hotels. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) makes service animals legally exempt from any hotel “pet policies.
Bottom line: no law requires hotels to accommodate household pets during a natural disaster. Pet owners should plan accordingly."

						Did U.S. Taxpayers Pay Over $90 Billion More Under Trump’s Tax Law?","In 2018, American taxpayers paid over $90 billion more under the Trump administration's tax law than they did the previous year.","True
					
						
							About this rating","On 4 June 2019, Yahoo! Finance reported that as a result of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) enacted by the Trump administration, “the IRS pulled in an additional $93 billion for 2018 from taxpayers on individual income taxes than it did for 2017.” With the tax law being a hot partisan topic, many readers who saw the headline online asked us whether it was true.
In that article, Yahoo! Finance reported:
The IRS collected $1.97 trillion in gross collections (the amount before refunds) for 2018. That figure stood at roughly $1.87 trillion for 2017. Refunds did increase this year — but not by much. The IRS refunded about $398 billion to taxpayers for 2018. For 2017, it was roughly $386 billion.
And after refunds, the IRS collected about $93 billion more from individual American taxpayers than it did in 2017. Interestingly, that number stands close to the tax break amount that corporations received from the TCJA in 2018. Last year, big businesses paid $91 billion less in taxes than they had in 2017, prior to the new law’s passage.
The numbers reported by Yahoo! Finance are accurate, cited from figures published by the IRS in its 2018 Data Book. Collections data for fiscal years 2017 and 2018 can be viewed in the following table, while 2017 refund data can be downloaded by clicking  here:

However, it’s still too early to tease out the long-term effects of the new tax law from 2018 data, according to Matthew Gardner, senior fellow and corporate tax expert at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy (ITEP), a non-partisan nonprofit organization that researches tax policy.
Republicans had wanted to tell the story about new tax cuts fueling economic growth that would offset lost revenue, while Democrats had been eager to frame the new law as a gift to the country’s wealthiest individuals and large corporations at the expense of average Americans.
As Yahoo! finance reporter Kristin Myer pointed out on the news outlet’s show “The First Trade,” it appeared that taxpayers had “filled the gap” left by corporate tax cuts in 2018.
“I would absolutely agree that if you look at the tax bill as written, unambiguously this is a shift away from taxing corporations toward taxing individuals,” Gardner said.
Gardner is a critic of TCJA because it cut the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent without fixing loopholes that corporations have long exploited. “We needed corporate tax reform, and we didn’t get it. We just got corporate tax cuts,” Gardner told us. However, irregularities that occurred in both fiscal years 2017 and 2018 can paint a misleading picture of the long-term impact of the TCJA.
Among others reasons, 2017 tax filings were artificially depressed because the IRS granted filing extensions to victims of natural disasters such as Hurricane Harvey in Texas. Conversely, filings were up in 2018 when those delayed tax returns were finally submitted.
Furthermore, the law went into effect on 1 January 2018, meaning it wasn’t in force for the entirety of the fiscal year, which starts in October. “I wouldn’t take these fiscal year ’18 data very seriously as an indicator of what the tax cuts are doing in any sense,” Gardner said. “No one should expect to fully see those effects emerge in the 2018 fiscal year. We have to wait until next year to really get a look at the impact on collections.”
Politicians on both sides of the aisle were anxious to see how the new law would affect tax refunds because, as Bloomberg reported, “Getting a tax refund is a springtime tradition that Americans love as much as Easter candy.” And as Yahoo! observed, “In the end, many Americans saw modest increases in their paychecks throughout the year, but didn’t notice. Instead, as people filed, many bemoaned getting smaller-than-anticipated refunds or even being hit with a ‘surprise’ tax bill.”
Democratic lawmakers seized on the lower refunds, with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-New York) stating, according to Yahoo!, that “Many Americans depend on their tax refund to pay bills and make ends meet, but this tax season, working families will see smaller than expected returns and surprise tax bills — because the Trump administration used smoke and mirrors in a shallow attempt to exaggerate the impact of their tax law on middle class families for political reasons.”"

							About this rating","In the days following Hurricane Harvey, which caused catastrophic flooding in southeast Texas in late August 2017, an image began circulating online that appeared to show President Donald Trump leaning over the side of a raft, reaching out to a stranded flood victim.

 	 	 	 	 	 	 0:00 / 0:00

Tellingly, the President is pictured wearing a suit and no life vest — an unlikely scenario in a dangerous flood. Presidents also generally do not personally take part in rescue operations after disasters.

The image, unsurprisingly, was digitally altered. The original can be found on CNN’s web site and actually depicts three rescuers with the Austin Fire Department reaching out to help a man clinging to a chain link fence out of the water:

The original incident did not even take place during Hurricane Harvey in 2017. Instead, the image captures a rescue that occurred in the aftermath of flooding in Central Texas in 2015, before Donald Trump was elected president.

Video of the rescue was captured by Austin’s KXAN News:

President Trump did visit storm-ravaged southeast Texas after Hurricane Harvey on 29 August 2017, but he did not go out on floodwaters to rescue victims."

							About this rating","On 25 August 2017, Hurricane Harvey made landfall in Texas, bringing extended heavy rainfall, flooding, and, of course, rumors and scams in its wake.
One such rumor involved high-paying Federal Emergency Management Agency jobs (“FEMA Field Inspectors”) purportedly created by the storm. Readers forwarded various versions of the rumor they spotted on social media, most mentioning a “Mr. Adrian Davis” recruiting a thousand workers for positions paying between $2,000 and $5,000 per week:
FEMA is looking to hire help. $2000 per week plus expenses. 90 days or longer they need over 1000 people. Cannot have any felonies. 888 776 1296. Mr. Adrian Davis.

True of False?

I have not been able to verify this-the phone number goes from a fast busy to a regular busy.

Thank you

There is a post going around Facebook seeking FEMA Field Inspectors. $4-5 K per week. No experience necessary. The ad contains an error: “Will be reimburse travel”

The phone number to call is 214-[redacted].

All sounds too good to be true and I don’t see anything similar on the FEMA website or Facebook page.

Can you please check out a rumor via Facebook that FEMA is paying people up to 5,000 dollars per week to work in Houston as field inspectors. They have to call 214.[redacted] to register.

Why wouldn’t the FEMA hire people directly? Sounds like a HUGE scam to me!!
The rumor spread quickly, thanks to its plausible premise of FEMA being understaffed in August 2017, the high (but not impossibly so) pay described, and the ease with which one could plausibly qualify. Although some iterations listed an area code of (888) and a contact name of “Adrian Davis,” others provided a 214 (Dallas-area) number which appears to have no affiliation with FEMA. A poster provided an application deadline of 31 August 2017:

On 30 August 2017, the agency addressed the “FEMA Field Inspectors” rumor on its official Facebook page:
FEMA linked to a Hurricane Harvey page, with an expandable section titled “Rumor Control.” That section revealed that the rumor was in fact mostly true:

							About this rating","A host of rumors concerning the American Red Cross and their disaster relief efforts cropped up in September 2017 after a string of hurricanes battered the United States. Among them was a photograph that purportedly showed a meal served by the nonprofit organization in Texas after Hurricane Harvey:

The pictured meal, consisting of some slices of ham and cheese, crackers, and cauliflower, actually shows a school lunch that was served to a student in Chickasha, Oklahoma, in 2014:
Angry parents in Chickasha complain their kids aren’t getting enough to eat at school. The Holton family says the meal the district calls a “Munchable” is ridiculous and family members say it needs to change.
The meal that daughter Kaytlin Shelton took a photo of consists of lunch meat, a couple crackers, a slice of cheese and two pieces of cauliflower. Schools in Chickasha serve it every other week.
Kelly Tyco, a reporter for the newspaper TC Palm, posted a picture of a  real meal served by the Red Cross at a shelter at Hidden Oaks Middle School in Florida after Hurricane Irma. That meal included a hamburger, french fries, and fresh fruit and vegetables:

	
		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		

A controversy over portion sizes did arise in September 2016 when the Red Cross provided meals to victims of severe flooding in Louisiana and some meal recipients posted photographs apparently showing disturbingly meager offerings:
<img loading=""lazy"" class=""aligncenter wp-image-103757"" src=""https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/09/red-cross-meal-2016.jpg"" alt="""" width=""600"" height=""800"" data-recalc-dims=""1"" srcset=""https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/09/red-cross-meal-2016.jpg?resize=720%2C960&amp;zoom=1 720w, https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/09/red-cross-meal-2016.jpg?resize=720%2C960&amp;zoom=0.5 360w, https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/09/red-cross-meal-2016.jpg?resize=720%2C960&amp;zoom=0.25 180w"" sizes=""(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px"" />
However, the scanty portions were not representative of all Red Cross meals served during that disaster,   as we reported at the time
The Red Cross acknowledged that some food boxes went out with ridiculously small portions: the result of an error, [Red Cross spokesman Jay] Bonafede said, which was subsequently corrected. The user who posted the chicken nuggets and peas photograph said he received an apology from the organization.
The Red Cross was also subjected to rumors holding that they were charging victims for their services (false), that they refused to serve hamburgers (mixture), and that they threw away hundreds of pounds of donations (unproven). In response, the nonprofit published a post on Facebook about the dangers of rumors and misinformation:"

Like his predecessor, the 45th President of the United States (and his family) were frequently the subject of digital hoaxes. Trump’s head was digitally added onto other people’s bodies, certain physical attributes were exaggerated in unflattering ways, and photographs of Trump impersonators committing vile acts were circulated as if they were authentic. 
Here are some hoax photographs of President Trump — and a few of his family — that were passed around on social media in 2017. 
Antagonizing a Marine:
In July 2017, a Facebook page accused CNN of doctoring a video to show President Trump ripping off a Marine’s hat and placing it on the ground:
	
		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		

This actual footage has been reversed to make it seem like an opportunistic hat-grab. However, the real video (which actually did air on CNN) showed Trump picking up the soldier’s hat and placing it back on his head. 
The “Liar in Chief” cover of Time Magazine:
If you only count genuine issues of Time magazine, then Donald Trump has graced the cover fourteen times. If you include the fakes, well, that number grows by at least two. One fake Time Magazine cover was spotted at one of his golf courses, and another was circulated in June 2017 under the title “Liar in Chief”:

The penis-shaped motorcade:
What do police officers think of President Trump? According to a doctored image, a group of officers escorting Trump to his golf course rode in a phallic formation around the President’s car. The image is fake, of course, and has actually been around since at least 2014, when it was shared with similar jokes about Russian leader Vladimir Putin:

Unflattering image makeovers:
Trump’s coloring and appearance was the subject of ridicule throughout the first year of his presidency. And although Trump may not be as svelte as his predecessor, many of the photographs purportedly showing Trump’s poor physical condition have been exaggerated. 
Videographer Vic Berger, for instance, took a genuine image of Trump (left) and then added some subtle tweaks and changes to make an unflattering image of the president:
<img loading=""lazy"" class=""aligncenter wp-image-108458"" style=""border: 1px solid black;"" src=""https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/10/trump-vic-berger.jpg"" alt="""" width=""600"" height=""281"" data-recalc-dims=""1"" srcset=""https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/10/trump-vic-berger.jpg?resize=1000%2C468&amp;zoom=1 1000w, https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/10/trump-vic-berger.jpg?resize=1000%2C468&amp;zoom=0.5 500w, https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/10/trump-vic-berger.jpg?resize=1000%2C468&amp;zoom=0.25 250w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"" />
Trump goes golfing:
Another unflattering image of Trump purportedly shows the president golfing. This image, however, was created by pasting Trump’s face onto the body of legendary golfer John Daly:

Diapers, strippers, and balloon breasts:		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
In June 2017 we saw a number of “leaked” photographs purportedly showing Trump in compromising positions. In reality, these images were created by simply adding Trump’s head onto other people’s bodies.
This, for instance, does not portray Trump wearing a diaper in an unflatteringly-lit sex dungeon, but a digital creation:

This is not Trump with a stripper on his lap:

And this is not Trump wearing a pair of balloons as mock breasts:

Diarrhea on the golf course:		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
Perhaps the most unflattering, most crude, and consequently most viral image of President Donald Trump purportedly shows him soiling his pants on a golf course. This image was featured in at least one fake news article giving a fictional account of the incident, lending it undeserved credence.
Of course, it was just another doctored photograph based on a real image of Trump golfing (but in pants that remained unsoiled):
<img loading=""lazy"" class=""aligncenter wp-image-120019"" style=""border: 1px solid black;"" src=""https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/12/trump-collage.jpg"" alt="""" width=""600"" height=""801"" data-recalc-dims=""1"" srcset=""https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/12/trump-collage.jpg?resize=1002%2C1337&amp;zoom=1 1002w, https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/12/trump-collage.jpg?resize=1002%2C1337&amp;zoom=0.5 501w, https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/12/trump-collage.jpg?resize=1002%2C1337&amp;zoom=0.25 251w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1002px) 100vw, 1002px"" />
Trump the rescuer:
Not all of the fake photographs of Trump were unflattering. In fact, some painted him in a heroic light. During Hurricane Harvey, for example, an image appeared showing the president personally rescuing people and animals from flooding. 
But alas, the images did not actually show President Donald Trump decked out in a “Make America Great Again” hat while carrying two cats to safety:
<img loading=""lazy"" class=""aligncenter wp-image-102840"" style=""border: 1px solid black;"" src=""https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/09/man-saves-cats.jpg"" alt="""" width=""600"" height=""276"" data-recalc-dims=""1"" srcset=""https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/09/man-saves-cats.jpg?resize=1000%2C460&amp;zoom=1 1000w, https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/09/man-saves-cats.jpg?resize=1000%2C460&amp;zoom=0.5 500w, https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/09/man-saves-cats.jpg?resize=1000%2C460&amp;zoom=0.25 250w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"" />
Nor is this Trump rescuing people from a raft:

Spray tan and the Klan:
Digital editing software isn’t the only way to create hoax photographs. If you have the resources, you can also hire actors to impersonate the president. Photographer Alison Jackson is well known for using lookalikes to stage photographs depicting celebrities in embarrassing situations.
Although her work targets a wide-range of celebrities and politicians, Donald Trump has been featured in a number of her pieces, such as this image purportedly showing Trump getting a spray tan in the oval office:
<img loading=""lazy"" class=""aligncenter wp-image-120032"" style=""border: 1px solid black;"" src=""https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/12/trump-tweet-1.jpg"" alt="""" width=""600"" height=""733"" data-recalc-dims=""1"" srcset=""https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/12/trump-tweet-1.jpg?resize=589%2C720&amp;zoom=1 589w, https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/12/trump-tweet-1.jpg?resize=589%2C720&amp;zoom=0.5 295w, https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/12/trump-tweet-1.jpg?resize=589%2C720&amp;zoom=0.25 147w"" sizes=""(max-width: 589px) 100vw, 589px"" />
Jackson also used an actor to stage a photograph of the president at a Ku Klux Klan rally:
<img loading=""lazy"" class=""aligncenter wp-image-73436"" style=""border: 1px solid black;"" src=""https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/01/trump-kkk.jpg"" alt="""" width=""600"" height=""429"" data-recalc-dims=""1"" srcset=""https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/01/trump-kkk.jpg?resize=1119%2C801&amp;zoom=1 1119w, https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/01/trump-kkk.jpg?resize=1119%2C801&amp;zoom=0.5 560w, https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/01/trump-kkk.jpg?resize=1119%2C801&amp;zoom=0.25 280w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1119px) 100vw, 1119px"" />
Trump meets the Pope:
Jimmy Kimmel used a similar technique for a segment spoofing President Trump’s meeting with the Pope. Although this was an obvious fake when it was aired on Jimmy Kimmel Live!, the clip fooled many viewers when it was edited down to just a few brief moments and shared along with a fake CNN logo: 

Some of the kids:
The rest of the immediate Trump family did not get through 2017 unscathed; for example, three of his children (Eric, Don Jr. and Ivanka Trump) were also featured in a few fake images. 
An oddly grotesque photograph of Trump’s two sons went viral in June 2017, thanks in part to some subtle (yet effective) editing that convinced many viewers that the image was real. When compared with the genuine photograph, however, it is clear that several edits were made to the photograph. For instance, Donald Trump, Jr.’s upper lip was enlarged, his bottom teeth were hidden, his right eye was moved off-center, and his left ear was lowered. Eric Trump’s eyes were made more wide-set and some extra fat was added to his neck.
Here’s the fake image (left) and the real image (right):
<img loading=""lazy"" class=""aligncenter wp-image-97168"" style=""border: 1px solid black;"" src=""https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/07/spot-the-difference.jpg"" alt="""" width=""600"" height=""373"" data-recalc-dims=""1"" srcset=""https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/07/spot-the-difference.jpg?resize=1000%2C622&amp;zoom=1 1000w, https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/07/spot-the-difference.jpg?resize=1000%2C622&amp;zoom=0.5 500w, https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/07/spot-the-difference.jpg?resize=1000%2C622&amp;zoom=0.25 250w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"" />
Ivanka Trump also received the fake photograph treatment. Instead of exaggerating her features into ugly proportions, however, hoaxers took a different tactic of showing her cuddling with Russian president Vladimir Putin. Of course, Putin was not the man in the middle in the original photograph; the real image showed Ivanka Trump with Wendi Murdoch and film director Baz Luhrmann:
<img loading=""lazy"" class=""aligncenter wp-image-120033"" style=""border: 1px solid black;"" src=""https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/12/not-ivana-and-putin.jpg"" alt="""" width=""600"" height=""298"" data-recalc-dims=""1"" srcset=""https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/12/not-ivana-and-putin.jpg?resize=1002%2C497&amp;zoom=1 1002w, https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/12/not-ivana-and-putin.jpg?resize=1002%2C497&amp;zoom=0.5 501w, https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/12/not-ivana-and-putin.jpg?resize=1002%2C497&amp;zoom=0.25 251w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1002px) 100vw, 1002px"" />
In conclusion: Don’t believe anything without corroborating evidence, even when the proof appears to be right in front of your eyes."

						Desert Detention Camp for Migrant Kids Still Growing",null,"This article is republished here with permission from The Associated Press. This content is shared here because the topic may interest Snopes readers; it does not, however, represent the work of Snopes fact-checkers or editors.","TORNILLO, Texas (AP) — The Trump administration announced in June it would open a temporary shelter for up to 360 migrant children in this isolated corner of the Texas desert. Less than six months later, the facility has expanded into a detention camp holding thousands of teenagers — and it shows every sign of becoming more permanent.
By Monday, 2,349 largely Central American boys and girls between the ages of 13 and 17 were sleeping inside the highly guarded facility in rows of bunk beds in canvas tents, some of which once housed first responders to Hurricane Harvey. More than 1,300 teens have arrived since the end of October alone.
Rising from the cotton fields and dusty roads not far from the dark fence marking the border between the U.S. and Mexico, the camp has rows of beige tents and golf carts that ferry staffers carrying walkie-talkies. Teens with identical haircuts and government-issued shirts and pants can be seen walking single file from tent to tent, flanked by staff at the front and back.
More people are detained than Tornillo’s tent city than in all but one of the nation’s 204 federal prisons, yet construction here continues.
The camp’s population may grow even more if members of the migrant caravans castigated by President Trump enter the U.S. Federal officials have said they may fly teens from the caravans who arrive in San Diego directly to El Paso, then bus them to Tornillo, according to a nonprofit social service provider who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not allowed to publicly discuss the matter.
	
		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
An Associated Press investigation has found that the camp’s rapid growth has created problems, including:
— Costs appear to be soaring more than 50 percent higher than the government has disclosed: What began as an emergency, 30-day shelter has transformed into a vast tent city that could cost taxpayers more than $430 million.
— The government is allowing the nonprofit running the tent city to sidestep mental health care requirements: Under federal policy, migrant youth shelters generally must have one mental health clinician for every 12 kids, but shelter officials told AP the facility has just one mental health clinician for every 50 kids.
— Federal plans to close Tornillo by New Years’ Eve will be nearly impossible to meet: There aren’t 2,300 extra beds in other facilities. A contract obtained by AP shows the project could continue into 2020 and planned closures have already been extended three times since this summer.
Tornillo’s teens were not separated from their families at the border this summer, but they’re held there because federal immigration policies have resulted in the detention of a record 14,000 migrant children, filling shelter beds around the country to capacity. Almost all came on their own from Central America hoping to join family members in the United States.
Some children have been detained at Tornillo since the tent camp opened in June. As the population inside the tall wire fences swells, and as some children stay there longer, the young detainees’ anguish has deepened.
“The few times they let me call my mom I would tell her that one day I would be free, but really I felt like I would be there for the rest of my life,” a 17-year-old from Honduras who was held at Tornillo earlier this year told AP. “I feel so bad for the kids who are still there. What if they have to spend Christmas there? They need a hug, and nobody is allowed to hug there.”
After his family passed extensive background checks, the teen was recently released to them, but said he still has nightmares he’s back inside. He spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal from immigration authorities.		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
Confining and caring for so many children is a challenge. By day, minders walk the teen detainees to their meals, showers and recreation on the arid plot of land guarded by multiple levels of security. At night the area around the camp, that’s grown from a few dozen to more than 150 tents, is secured and lit up by flood lights.
The nonprofit social service agency contracted to run Tornillo says it is proud of its work. It says it is operating the facility with the same precision and care used for shelters put up after natural disasters.
“We don’t have anything to hide. This is an exceptionally run operation,” said Krista Piferrer, a spokeswoman for BCFS Health and Human Services, a faith-based organization that runs Tornillo. “This isn’t our first rodeo.”
She said they have no guidance from the Trump administration regarding what will happen after Dec. 31.
A spokesman for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Mark Weber, said no decisions have been made about whether Tornillo will close by year’s end as scheduled.
“Whatever it is we decide to do, in the very near future, we’ll do a public notice about that,” he said.
‘NOBODY KNOWS’
More than 50 years of research show institutionalizing young people is traumatizing, with harmful impacts on their psyche and life trajectories, prompting policymakers to seek alternatives to locking up children, said Naomi Smoot, executive director of the nonprofit Coalition for Juvenile Justice.		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
“Hearing that more than 2,000 kids are in any kind of detention facility is alarming to me,” she said. “That’s not where kids should be around the holidays, particular when they haven’t broken the law.”
Most of the children locked inside Tornillo are never charged with a crime; crossing illegally into the U.S. is a civil offense. By law, migrant children traveling alone into the U.S. must be sent to a government shelter where they stay until they can be united with relatives or other sponsors while awaiting immigration court hearings. Migrant children’s time in government custody has grown longer this year, in part due to the Trump administration’s new requirements for deep background checks on sponsors who agree to take in young immigrants.
Tornillo currently has 3,800 beds for the teens, with 1,400 of those on reserve.
Annunciation House director Ruben Garcia, whose El Paso nonprofit works with recent immigrants, said Tornillo is far more secretive than other government shelters, where he and his staff are routinely allowed inside. At Tornillo workers must sign non-disclosure agreements and visitors are rarely allowed.
“What’s happening inside? Nobody knows. They cannot speak about what they see,” he said. “We’ve been doing this work for 20 years and we’ve never seen anything like this.”
BCFS says the shelter at Tornillo has actually had more media, elected officials, advocacy organizations, child welfare experts and attorneys tour the site than any other operation for migrant children run by HHS. The nonprofit said confidentiality agreements are standard, to protect the privacy and rights of clients and those served.
‘COUNTING THE DAYS’
In June, as migrant child detention centers overflowed, HHS announced it was opening a rapidly built tent city at Tornillo, with the idea that most kids would only stay a few days. But within the week there was talk of making a detention camp 10 times as big.		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
Because the detention camp is on federal property — part of a large U.S. Customs and Border facility — it is not subject to state licensing requirements.
BCFS, a San Antonio nonprofit, runs Tornillo as it operates evacuation centers for hurricanes: there’s food, first aid, activities and rows of bunk beds, but no normal-life activities for stressed-out teens, like formal school or unsupervised stretches.
Federal officials have said repeatedly that only children without special needs were being sent to Tornillo. But facility administrators recently acknowledged to care providers that the Tornillo detainees included children with serious mental health issues who needed to be transferred out to facilities in El Paso in the coming days, according to a person with knowledge of the discussion. The person spoke on a condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk publicly about discussions.
BCFS confirmed that the current ratio of mental-health clinicians to children is 1 to 50, and said that each child sees a mental health specialist every day.
“When a child is found to have a mental health need that cannot be best provided for at Tornillo, a request is made to HHS to transfer the child to a more appropriate facility,” said Piferrer.
Dr. Ryan Matlow, a Stanford clinical psychologist whose work addresses the impact of early life stress, recently interviewed teens at Tornillo. He questions the facility’s capacity to identify kids with special mental health needs given the large number of children and their tendency to suppress emotional distress in order to cope.
“The kids are able to get by in there, but the more time they spend in these sorts of facilities, the greater the consequences, especially when it comes to their emotional and psychological well-being,” said Matlow. “It’s a dangerous and harmful system for kids to be caught in.”
Camilo Perez-Bustillo, who served as a Spanish-language interpreter at the camp earlier this month, said most of the two dozen children he met showed signs of depression and anxiety over when, or whether, they would be released. About two thirds are boys, and half of the teens are Guatemalan. There are no on-site interpreters for teens of indigenous origin who speak Spanish as a second language.
“They are all counting the days they are inside the way prisoners do,” said Perez-Bustillo, who is advocacy director at the nonprofit Hope Border Institute. “Many of the kids have the sense of being suspended, and anxiousness about how much longer they will be held there.”
Dr. Elizabeth Carll, a teen and trauma specialist who heads the American Psychological Association’s Refugee Mental Health resource network, said institutionalizing so many teens in a geographically remote place makes it harder to recruit qualified clinicians.
“You have to find people who are licensed, who are experts in trauma, who speak Spanish and have worked with teens,” she said. “Where would you find all these qualified professionals?”
Making things worse, Carll said migrant youth are likely to have higher emotional needs after going through hardship, enduring the journey north and being held in detention. They would do better if placed with trained, bilingual foster families, she said.
One shy 16-year-old from Honduras held at Tornillo told an AP reporter as she awaited her immigration court hearing that she was worried that it was taking so long to reunite her with family in Pennsylvania.
“I’m getting tired of waiting because I’ve been there three months,” said the girl, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution by staffers who were monitoring her and other Tornillo detainees. “I’m trying to keep the faith that I will be liberated soon.”
$1,200 PER NIGHT
For each night each child spends at Tornillo, taxpayers spend up to $1,200 to pay the direct care workers, cooks, cleaners, teachers and emergency services workers, according to information staff at two congressional offices said they were provided on a recent visit. That’s well above the $775 officials have publicly disclosed, and close to five times more than a typical youth migrant shelter costs.
BCFS did not dispute the cost, but said on average, actual costs are closer to $750 a day, which would bring current operations to more than $12 million a week.
The costs at Tornillo are so high because everything — water, sewage, food, staff and detainees — must be trucked in and out of the remote site. Every few hours, two teams fill up 2,000-gallon tanks of water from a hydrant outside the facility, then drive them back through the fences. Each day, 35,000 gallons of diesel are trucked in as well, to run massive generators that power air conditioners in blazing hot summers and heaters on frigid winter nights.
The teens can play soccer during closely watched recreation periods. They are given yarn to pass the time making brightly colored bracelets and scarves. There aren’t regular classes, but teens have textbooks and workbooks.
Piferrer said BCFS was not charging the government for the tents, fire trucks and ambulance on site.
“We are not going to charge for resources that we already own,” she said. “Everything that is being provided has been directed by the federal government to be provided.”
Scant details about how those funds are spent motivated New York-based software developer Josh Rubin to set up residence in an RV just outside the gates, where he keeps a vigil on the vehicles going in and out. In recent weeks, he said, he has spotted new trends: construction trucks moving equipment in to build another tent, a vehicle carrying heaters, more buses with tinted windows taking children to immigration court.
Staffers are transported to the camp from motels near the El Paso airport, where the tour buses take pains to park on side roads, far from view. On a recent evening outside the Hawthorn Suites hotel, Tornillo workers filed off to bed in the darkness, many talking of feeling sick or exhausted.
Twice a day, the desolate stretch of highway outside Tornillo comes alive as more than a dozen tour buses pull up. Bells sound, lights flash. Workers walk in two by two, wearing khaki pants, neon jackets and backpacks, some wrapped in scarves to guard against the cool desert air.
Many days, Rubin is there alone, holding up a sign saying “Free Them” at the tent city’s entrance. Sometimes the train rumbles by, or cotton drifts in the wind.
Protests began at Tornillo almost as soon as it opened. State and federal elected officials joined local activists and Hollywood stars deriding the Trump administration’s immigration policies. But public attention turned elsewhere, and now demonstrations are rare.
On a recent afternoon, a group of about 60 activists including rabbis from Ann Arbor, Michigan and students from a local Catholic girls’ school assembled to pray for the teens’ release and sang a throaty version of “Let My People Go.”
After a Department of Homeland Security official blocked them, the group ventured through a fence onto a private dirt road behind the facility. A group of teen boys could be seen across marshland, and a hole in the wire fence had been visibly patched.
“You are not alone!” the activists cried out in Spanish to the youth being led between tents. Some of the teens waved back. One protester wiped away a tear as another banged on a plastic drum, calling out “We love you! We miss you!”
Dalila Reynoso-Gonzalez, a program director for the Methodist immigration advocacy group Justice for our Neighbors of East Texas, said she was moved to demonstrate at Tornillo after helping an immigrant father reunite with his son held there. The boy told her stories of a stark and lonely place and spoke of isolation, fear, disorientation.
He still has a foil blanket issued to him when he first was taken into custody, she said.
“It’s really heavy on my heart,” said Reynoso-Gonzalez. “How did we get to this place, why do we have so many children out there?”"

						2 Dams and Levee Overflow, Adding to Houston Floodwater",null,"This article is republished here with permission from The Associated Press. This content is shared here because the topic may interest Snopes readers; it does not, however, represent the work of Snopes fact-checkers or editors.","HOUSTON (AP) — A pair of 70-year-old reservoir dams that protect downtown Houston and a levee in a suburban subdivision began overflowing Tuesday, adding to the rising floodwaters from Harvey that have crippled the area after five consecutive days of rain.
Brazoria County authorities posted a message on Twitter warning that the levee at Columbia Lakes south of Houston had been breached and telling people to “GET OUT NOW!!!” Brazoria County Judge Matt Sebesta said residents were warned that the levee would be overtopped at some point, and a mandatory evacuation order was given Sunday.
Engineers began releasing water from the Addicks and Barker reservoirs Monday to ease the strain on the dams. But the releases were not enough to relieve the pressure after one of the heaviest downpours in U.S. history, Army Corps of Engineers officials said. Both reservoirs are at record highs.
The release of the water means that more homes and streets will flood, and some homes will be inundated for up to a month, said Jeff Lindner of the Harris County Flood Control District.
The county is trying to determine where the water will go, Lindner said.
	
		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
Meanwhile, more than 17,000 people are seeking refuge in Texas shelters, the American Red Cross said. With rescues continuing, that number seemed certain to grow.
Calls for rescue have so overwhelmed emergency teams that they have had little time to search for bodies. And officials acknowledge that fatalities from Harvey could soar once the floodwaters start to recede from one of America’s most sprawling metropolitan centers.
More than four days after the storm ravaged the Texas coastline as a Category 4 hurricane, authorities had confirmed only three deaths — including a woman killed Monday when heavy rains dislodged a large oak tree onto her trailer home in the small town of Porter. But unconfirmed reports of others missing or presumed dead were growing.
“We know in these kinds of events that, sadly, the death toll goes up historically,” Houston Police Chief Art Acevedo told The Associated Press. “I’m really worried about how many bodies we’re going to find.”
One Houston woman said Monday that she presumes six members of a family, including four of her grandchildren, died after their van sank into Greens Bayou in East Houston.
Virginia Saldivar told The Associated Press her brother-in-law was driving the van Sunday when a strong current took the vehicle over a bridge and into the bayou. The driver was able to get out and urged the children to escape through the back door, Saldivar said, but they could not.
“I’m just hoping we find the bodies,” Saldivar said.
Houston emergency officials could not confirm the deaths.		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
A spokeswoman for a Houston hotel said one of its employees disappeared while helping about 100 guests and workers evacuate the building.
The disaster is unfolding on an epic scale, with the nation’s fourth-largest city mostly paralyzed by the storm that parked itself over the Gulf Coast. With nearly 2 more feet (61 centimeters) of rain expected on top of the 30-plus inches (76 centimeters) in some places, authorities worried the worst might be yet to come.
Harvey kept drenching Houston and the surrounding area. Rain fell Tuesday at about half an inch (1 centimeter) per hour over Harris County — home to Houston — and up to 2 inches (5 centimeters) per hour to the east.
The Houston metro area covers about 10,000 square miles (25,900 square kilometers), an area slightly bigger than New Jersey. It’s crisscrossed by about 1,700 miles (2,700 kilometers) of channels, creeks and bayous that drain into the Gulf of Mexico, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) to the southeast from downtown.
President Donald Trump was expected Tuesday in Corpus Christi and Austin for briefings on the first major natural disaster of his administration. Vice President Mike Pence said in an interview with Corpus Christi radio station KKTX that he will visit southeast Texas later this week.
Forecasters expect the storm to linger over the Gulf before heading back inland east of Houston sometime Wednesday. The system will then head north and lose its tropical strength.
It could creep as far east as Mississippi by Thursday, meaning New Orleans, where Hurricane Katrina unleashed its full wrath in 2005, is in Harvey’s path. Foreboding images of Harvey were lighting up weather radar screens early Tuesday, the 12th anniversary of the day Katrina made landfall in Plaquemines Parish.
Rescuers meanwhile continued plucking people from inundated Houston neighborhoods. Mayor Sylvester Turner put the number by police at more than 3,000. The Coast Guard said it also had rescued more than 3,000 by boat and air and was taking more than 1,000 calls per hour.		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
Chris Thorn was among the many volunteers still helping with the mass evacuation that began Sunday. He drove with a buddy from the Dallas area with their flat-bottom hunting boat to pull strangers out of the water.
“I couldn’t sit at home and watch it on TV and do nothing since I have a boat and all the tools to help,” he said.
Nearly 6,000 inmates displaced by flooding have been moved from prisons in the Houston area to other facilities in South and East Texas, according to the state Department of Criminal Justice.
A mandatory evacuation was ordered for the low-lying Houston suburb of Dickinson, home to 20,000. Police cited the city’s fragile infrastructure in the floods, limited working utilities and concern about the weather forecast.
In Houston, questions continued to swirl about why the mayor did not issue a similar evacuation order.
Turner has repeatedly defended the decision and did so again Monday, insisting that a mass evacuation of millions of people by car was a greater risk than enduring the storm.
“Both the county judge and I sat down together and decided that we were not in direct path of the storm, of the hurricane, and the safest thing to do was for people to stay put, make the necessary preparations. I have no doubt that the decision we made was the right decision.”
He added, “Can you imagine if millions of people had left the city of Houston and then tried to come back in right now?”		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
By Tuesday morning, more than 9,000 people were at the city’s largest shelter set up inside the George R. Brown Convention Center — which originally had an estimated capacity of 5,000.
Red Cross spokesman Lloyd Ziel said that volunteers made more space inside the center, which also was used to house Hurricane Katrina refugees from New Orleans in 2005, in part by pushing some cots closer together. A shortage of cots means some people will have to sleep on chairs or the floor.
The center settled down at night, after an occasionally chaotic day that saw thousands of evacuees arrive in the pouring rain. Officers and volunteers at times rushed to attend to those with medical needs.
Before the storm is gone, up to 20 more inches (51 centimeters) of rain could fall, National Weather Service Director Louis Uccellini said Monday.
That means the flooding will get worse in the days ahead and the floodwaters will be slow to recede once Harvey finally moves on, the weather service said.
Sometime Tuesday or early Wednesday, parts of the Houston region will probably break the nearly 40-year-old U.S. record for the biggest rainfall from a tropical system — 48 inches (120 centimeters) — set by Tropical Storm Amelia in 1978 in Texas, meteorologists said.

						Airlines Battle Price-Gouging Allegations as Hurricane Irma Advances on Florida",null,null,"Several airlines instituted price caps on flights out of Florida after being accused online of gouging prices in advance of Hurricane Irma making landfall in the state.
As recently as 7 September 2017, people in Miami — which is projected to be in the path of the storm center — reported seeing exorbitant prices on travel booking websites.
Earlier on in the day, our own search for flights out of Miami on the website Kayak.com (a third-party site that lists prices available through travel retailers) showed United Airlines flights leaving the city on 8 September 2017 to Los Angeles and returning three days later priced as high as $2,014:
<img loading=""lazy"" class=""size-full wp-image-103187 aligncenter"" style=""border: 1px solid black;"" src=""https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/09/United-Kayak1-Miami-to-LA-roundtrip.jpg"" alt="""" width=""600"" height=""259"" data-recalc-dims=""1"" srcset=""https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/09/United-Kayak1-Miami-to-LA-roundtrip.jpg?resize=600%2C259&amp;zoom=1 600w, https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/09/United-Kayak1-Miami-to-LA-roundtrip.jpg?resize=600%2C259&amp;zoom=0.5 300w, https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/09/United-Kayak1-Miami-to-LA-roundtrip.jpg?resize=600%2C259&amp;zoom=0.25 150w"" sizes=""(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"" />
However, those flights were no longer listed by the evening. United spokesperson Frank Benenati told us that while the airline typically only has 12 flights out of Miami per day (compared to more than 400 out of Texas, parts of which suffered extreme damage from Hurricane Harvey earlier in the month), it added six one-way flights out of Miami and Ft. Lauderdale “to get more folks out” and capped the price for each at $399.
	
		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
Another exhorbitant listing posted online — which has also been corrected — showed a United flight from Miami to Atlanta on 7 September costing just over $6,300. Benenati called that post “a glitch in the computer”:
We flew one of our international wide-body jets down to Florida, a plane that doesn’t typically do that route. The system kind of had a little glitch on one of the seats and someone saw that and thought that those were the prices for all of the seats, which wasn’t true. The second we saw it online we fixed it.
Delta Airlines was also criticized in a widely-distributed tweet on 5 September 2017 that included a picture of a flight from Miami to Phoenix, Arizona priced at $3,258.00:
<img loading=""lazy"" class=""size-full wp-image-103220 aligncenter"" style=""border: 1px solid black;"" src=""https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/09/Delta-price-tweet-5-September-2017.jpg"" alt="""" width=""600"" height=""342"" data-recalc-dims=""1"" srcset=""https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/09/Delta-price-tweet-5-September-2017.jpg?resize=600%2C342&amp;zoom=1 600w, https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/09/Delta-price-tweet-5-September-2017.jpg?resize=600%2C342&amp;zoom=0.5 300w, https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/09/Delta-price-tweet-5-September-2017.jpg?resize=600%2C342&amp;zoom=0.25 150w"" sizes=""(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"" />
After the image was shared more than 39,000 times  on Twitter, the poster praised the airline in a follow-up tweet:


.@Delta reached out & helped tremendously. Note to travelers, always call airline directly if something doesn’t look right.#IrmaHurricane
— Leigh (@LeighDow) September 5, 2017		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		

However, on 7 September, we found Delta flights to Newark International Airport in New Jersey for the same dates at just under $2,000:
<img loading=""lazy"" class=""size-full wp-image-103218 aligncenter"" style=""border: 1px solid black;"" src=""https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/09/Delta-via-Kayak-Miami-to-Newark-leaving-8-Sept.jpg"" alt="""" width=""600"" height=""388"" data-recalc-dims=""1"" srcset=""https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/09/Delta-via-Kayak-Miami-to-Newark-leaving-8-Sept.jpg?resize=600%2C388&amp;zoom=1 600w, https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/09/Delta-via-Kayak-Miami-to-Newark-leaving-8-Sept.jpg?resize=600%2C388&amp;zoom=0.5 300w, https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/09/Delta-via-Kayak-Miami-to-Newark-leaving-8-Sept.jpg?resize=600%2C388&amp;zoom=0.25 150w"" sizes=""(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"" />
In each case, those prices were not listed on Kayak by that evening. 
As the New York Times reported, those costly airfares may simply have been standard high-priced, last-minute fares that were only noticed due to the imminent arrival of a hurricane, not a deliberate attempt to price- gouge persons fleeing the storm:

The optics aren’t good for an industry that has had plenty of bad press recently, but the price increases causing the most recent public relations nightmare might just be business as usual.
“Sure, some are high, but last-minute fares are often more expensive in general,” George Hobica, the founder of AirfareWatchdog.com, wrote in an email. “I don’t think airlines would be callous or stupid enough to be consciously jacking up fares.”
Airfare data by Hopper shows that the price hikes that took place this past week are similar to those from two weeks ago, suggesting that the price changes are typical for a week of departure flights.
“If there’s any gouge, it’s just the last minute walk-up airfares that are designed for desperate business fliers,” Mr. Hobica said. “It’s just the computer programs doing what they do when it’s last minute and seats are scarce.”

Delta also released a statement on the controversy, saying that they would be capping fares for south Florida flights:
Delta has capped one-way fares in all cabins at $399 for flights to and from southern Florida through Sept. 13. Delta has been examining and adjusting fares in Florida since early this week, when Irma’s path became apparent and demand to fly out of the area surged.		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
Two other airlines, JetBlue and American Airlines, also instituted their own price caps for people looking to escape Irma as the hurricane headed toward Florida. The storm’s approach came less than a month after Hurricane Harvey caused widespread damage in southeast Texas.
Irma could also be followed soon by two other hurricanes, Jose and Katia. The sudden spate of potentially damaging storms, Benenati said, represents “a new dynamic” for United to contend with:
I think that Harvey and now Irma are not putting to the test what Mother Nature can do and the airlines will have to do as best they can in the situation that’s presented to them.
State Attorney General Pam Bondi has instituted a hotline for consumers to call if they suspected they were the victims of price-gouging. However, the state law against the practice only covers “essential items,” and not airline prices. An official with the Department of Transportation, which has jurisdiction over the issue, told us that the agency is currently evaluating complaints from areas affected by both Irma and Harvey.
A spokesperson for Bondi’s office, Kylie Mason, told us that more than 2,000 complaints about alleged price-gouging had been reported as of 7 September 2017. She added:
We are receiving complaints about airline tickets and have been in contact with airlines to request voluntary compliance.
Hurricane Irma, which has already killed at least 10 people, is projected to hit Florida’s southern region on 10 September 2017. Gov. Rick Scott (R) declared a state of emergency and as of press time, more than 650,000 residents of Miami-Dade County had been ordered to evacuate."

This is just sick! Emergency crews are working hard to make sure that they can be there to rescue Hurricane Harvey victims, but lefist punks from the Black Lives Matter clique don’t think people deserve to be saved.
While blacks whined about having to spend a few minutes on rooftops as George W. Bush worked hard to keep people safe after Hurricane Katrina hit, they are now so “woke” that their need to have people hear them scream that some thug who punched a cop got hurt (insert any one you can think of here) has dwarfed their desire to seed people safe from the Hurricane.
Police are currently engaged in a standoff with the “protesters,” who decided to block traffic because Donald Trump is a “racist” according to chants from the unruly mob.
Already, fire trucks and ambulances are forced to turn around and find another route after the Black Lives Crew decided to flip one of them on its side. Two paramedics were injured in the attack.
This story was reproduced by a number of other outlets and presented it as if it was a genuine news story. Our Land of the Free, however, is not a reputable source of news. The web site carries two disclaimers informing readers that it does not publish factual content:
We believe in the right to be free. No matter what, the freedom to do what we want, say what we want and publish what we want comes first. Therefore we make no guarantee that what you read here is true. In fact, it most definitely is not. Our Land Of The Free is here to entertain you with the kind of whimsical satire conservatives enjoy.

Ourlandofthefree.com makes no guarantee that anything you find here will be based at all in reality. All posts should be considered satirical and all images photoshopped to look like something they’re not. It’s not you, it’s me.
The image used by “Our Land of the Free” to illustrate this story does show Black Lives Matter protesters on a highway. However, this image was taken from a July 2016 CNN video, which shows a group of people protesting police shootings in Atlanta (during which time no emergency crews were blocked).
This is a recycled version of a story that has cropped up on a regular basis since at least 2015, generally implicating Black Lives Matter or anti-Trump protesters in the death of an innocent person. None of these stories have ever been proven to be true. 
We’ve encountered no reports of Black Lives Matter protesters interfering with the rescue efforts related to Hurricane Harvey, let alone flipping an ambulance on its side. This rumor originated from a fake news web site, and it featured a still shot from an unrelated video.
Having a group of protesters block major roads or freeway in Houston in the days after Harvey made landfall would be quite a feat at any rate, considering that most of its main thoroughfares and freeways were already underwater."

							About this rating","On 9 September 2017 the web site YourNewsWire.com published an item suggesting that theoretical physicist and CBS News contributor Michio Kaku had said that the recent hurricanes Harvey and Irma were the result of a government research program that shuttered in 2014. 
The article, titled “Top Scientist Tells CBS: HAARP Responsible For Recent Hurricanes,” claims that physicist and professor Michio Kaku had confessed that the High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program, an Alaska-based program created to analyze the ionosphere, which has been the subject of numerous conspiracy theories, had created the two deadly hurricanes:
World renowned physicist Dr. Michio Kaku made a shocking confession on live TV when he admitted that HAARP is responsible for the recent spate of hurricanes.
In an interview aired by CBS, Dr. Kaku admitted that recent ‘man-made’ hurricanes have been the result of a government weather modification program in which the skies were sprayed with nano particles and storms then “activated” through the use of “lasers”.
In the interview (below), Michio Kaku discusses the history of weather modification, before the CBS crew stop him in his tracks.
The High-Frequency Active Auroral Research Program (HAARP) was created in the early 1990’s as part of an ionospheric research program jointly funded by the U.S. Air Force, the U.S. Navy, the University of Alaska Fairbanks, and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA).
The claim quickly spread to several conspiracy blogs, YouTube channels, and Facebook pages in early September 2017.
Kaku never said that HAARP was responsible for hurricanes. YouTube videos espousing the conspiracy theory splice together misinformation about HAARP with an interview Kaku did with CBS News in 2013 in which he talked about the possibility of governments one day being able to cause rainfall using lasers and other means. 
	
		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
The description of the official video of the CBS interview read:
Scientists and researchers may one day be able to manipulate rain and lightning using lasers. “CBS This Morning” contributor Michio Kaku, a physics professor at City College of New York, talks to Charlie Rose and Norah O’Donnell about the potential future of weather.
 
In the video, Kaku also discusses the possibility that governments had manipulated weather in the past to cause or prevent rainstorms, and he calls the evidence “inconclusive” several times. He said of current efforts to manipulate the weather that there was “nothing conclusive … [but scientists are] bringing in the laws of physics” and “actually using trillion watt lasers” in such experiments. Kaku mentioned hurricanes at the end of a list of future theoretical weather modification applications:
… in the laboratory, sure enough they [now] precipitate rain out of water vapor … [but] the bad news is if it’s a clear blue sky, it’s not gonna do anything at all … outdoor events, and agriculture, and flooding, and even hurricanes all can be subject to weather modification.
We reached out to Kaku, who told us “The story is 100% false.”
Kaku also appeared on CBS in August 2017 to discuss Hurricane Harvey and the science behind hurricanes. He did not at any point say that HAARP had caused hurricanes."

The tweets were taken at face value by some mainstream media outlets (including Click2Houston), as well as by several right-leaning blogs such as Pacific Pundit, DC Clothesline, and Think Americana, with the latter using them as the basis for a report stating that “far leftists promote looting of homes and businesses of only Trump supporters”.
What we found when we looked at the tweets carefully, however, was that all of them were fake, originating from troll accounts set up under assumed identities. None of the photos depict anything that actually took place in Houston, much less in 2017. The image immediately above, for example, dates from 2009. The group photo of gang members in the tweet above that one originally appeared in the New York Daily News 2013. The image captioned “Crack open tha liquor store” was previously seen on the Internet in 2014. And the photo used in the “We lootin this bitch” tweet actually depicts a riot that took place in Charlotte, North Carolina in 2016.
It isn’t difficult to discern the motivation behind these fake tweets, which were obviously created to sow fear and racial hatred in a time of crisis. We have not only seen this phenomenon before, we have seen it perpetrated by the same bad actors.
Here, for example, is a tweet from the above-mentioned “Jayrome Williams” that appeared during a period of protests and rioting after a police shooting in Milwaukee, Wisconsin in August 2016 (note the hashtag: #MilwaukeeLootCrew):

In another tweet posted around the same time, “Jayrome” complains that “Jamaal,” his “brother” (whose Twitter handle had been “@187RUthless” — note similarity to “@RUthlessFCB” above) had been suspended from Twitter:

An archive of @BrotherTooTurnt’s older tweets shows him also using the hashtags #BaltimoreLootCrew and #AtlantaLootCrew.
As for “Jamaal,” before he opened his @RUthless187 Twitter account he went by the handle @187RUthless, which he used in March 2016 to convince a number of mainstream and alternative news web sites that he had filmed himself firing an automatic weapon to celebrate the cancellation of a Trump rally:

On Reddit and elsewhere, people have speculated that the trolling is an organized effort by members of 4chan, 8chan, gamers, or alt-right groups, but so far we haven’t found enough evidence to pin it on any particular person or group.
When last we checked, the Twitter accounts of both “Jamaal Williams” and “Jayrome Williams” had been deleted, though we’re confident these longtime Internet miscreants will return under other guises. Apart from those two, the majority of Twitter accounts we found posting under the hashtag #HarveyLootCrew are still active as of this writing."

						AP Exclusive: Most Florida Flood Zone Property Not Insured",null,"This article is republished here with permission from The Associated Press. This content is shared here because the topic may interest Snopes readers; it does not, however, represent the work of Snopes fact-checkers or editors.","FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) — As Hurricane Irma bears down on Florida, an Associated Press analysis shows a steep drop in flood insurance across the state, including the areas most endangered by what could be a devastating storm surge.
In just five years, the state’s total number of federal flood insurance policies has fallen by 15 percent, according to Federal Emergency Management Agency data.
Florida’s property owners still buy far more federal flood insurance than any other state — 1.7 million policies, covering about $42 billion in assets — but most residents in hazard zones are badly exposed.
With 1,350 miles of coastline, the most in the continental United States, Florida has roughly 2.5 million homes in hazard zones, more than three times that of any other state, FEMA estimates. And yet, across Florida’s 38 coastal counties, just 42 percent of these homes are covered.
Florida’s overall flood insurance rate for hazard-zone homes is just 41 percent. Fannie Mae ostensibly requires mortgage lenders to make sure property owners buy this insurance to qualify for federally backed loans, and yet in 59 percent of the cases, that insurance isn’t being paid for.
	
		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
In the counties being under at least partial evacuation orders Wednesday (Collier, Broward, Monroe and Miami-Dade), where 1.3 million houses are estimated to be in flood hazard zones, the percentage is an even lower 34.3 percent.
Nationwide, only half the 10 million properties that need flood insurance have it, said Roy Wright, who runs the National Flood Insurance Program. He told the AP last week that he wants to double the number of policies sold nationally in the near future.
The declines in coverage started after Congress approved a price hike in 2012, making policies more expensive. Maps of some high-risk areas were redrawn, removing a requirement that these homeowners get the insurance. About 7 of 10 homeowners have federally backed mortgages, and if they live in a high-risk area, they still are required to have flood insurance. But many let their policies slip without the lender noticing; loans also get sold and repackaged, paperwork gets lost and new lenders don’t follow up.
FEMA, which is ultimately responsible for enforcing flood insurance requirements, did not respond to an email seeking comment from its Washington office on Wednesday.
The latest forecasts suggest Irma’s most destructive winds could carve up much of Florida’s priciest real estate, damaging properties from the Florida Keys through Jacksonville as it swirls north.
“This could easily be the most costly storm in U.S. history, which is saying a lot considering what just happened two weeks ago,” said University of Miami hurricane researcher Brian McNoldy.
Insurance companies are still tallying the damage from Hurricane Harvey’s extended stay over southern Texas in August, but insured losses are estimated at $20 billion, and that’s a fraction of the $65 billion or more in losses due to flooding alone that could have been insured, according to the catastrophe modeling firm AIR Worldwide.
No one is expecting Irma to flood Florida on a similar scale. Harvey sat over Houston for days, dumping up to 50 inches of rain. Irma is moving swiftly and should bring less than a quarter of that to Florida cities.		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
South Florida also has a better flood control system, the ground is more porous and there aren’t any hills to send water rushing down from above, said Hugh Willoughby, a former research director at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and now a professor at Florida International University in Miami.
Still, many Floridians could find themselves with no money for flood repairs, just like people in Houston, where flood coverage dropped by 9 percent since 2012.
If Irma’s eye follows a track just west of Florida’s eastern coast, the initial storm surge could heavily damage the Florida Keys, the cities at the southern tip of Florida’s mainland, Florida City and Homestead, parts of Miami and Miami Beach, and other Atlantic coast cities, said Brian Haus, a professor of ocean sciences at the University of Miami’s Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science.
The AP analysis shows that the number of flood insurance policies sold in the Keys, Miami, Miami Beach and Homestead has stayed basically steady since 2012, but tiny Florida City has seen a drop of 31 percent. Miami-Dade County overall has seen a 7 percent drop in policies sold, falling from 371,000 in 2012 to 342,000 today.
Just to the north in Broward County, home to Fort Lauderdale, the state has seen its biggest drop among major counties, falling 44 percent from 372,000 policies five years ago to 207,000 today. County officials say they don’t track the flood insurance program, leaving that to the cities.
If Irma’s eye moves instead up Florida’s west coast, that would put Tampa, St. Petersburg and other Gulf cities in danger to significant storm surge, Haus said. St. Petersburg has seen an almost 10 percent drop in federal flood policies written in the last five years, while Tampa has seen a 3.5 percent drop, according to the AP analysis.

Although many viewers questioned the legitimacy of this image, according to the Galveston County Daily News it was indeed snapped at La Vita Bella nursing home in Dickinson, Texas (a city in Galveston County), from which fifteen senior citizens were evacuated by helicopter as the flood waters rose:

Fifteen senior citizens were evacuated from the La Vita Bella nursing home in Dickinson, David Popoff, the city’s emergency management coordinator confirmed on Sunday afternoon.
Poppoff said the residents were rescued by helicopter.
“We were air-lifting grandmothers and grandfathers,” Popoff said.
The picture was shared on Twitter by Timothy McIntosh, whose said his mother-in-law owns the assisted-living home.
His wife, Kimberly McIntosh, said her mother sent the picture at 9 a.m. [Sunday] morning.
“She said it was a disaster and they were hoping the national guard would come,” Kimberly McInstosh said.

According to CNN, the nursing home’s management had been instructed not to evacuate residents from the facility in advance of the storm, and they were unable to contact anyone who could help them get everyone to safety once the home began flooding:

“My mom sent it to me at 9 this morning. She said it was a disaster,” McIntosh said Sunday. “They [were] waiting for helicopters or the National Guard.”
“Most of these people are in wheelchairs and [on] oxygen,” she said.
McIntosh said that when she spoke to her mother, [Trudy] Lampson told McIntosh that the residence was not told to evacuate. Instead, they were instructed to stay in place and have a disaster plan.
McIntosh [said] the water became waist-deep 10 to 15 minutes after it first started flowing through the doors.
But when the situation turned dire and Lampson began reaching out for a rescue, she was told that first-responders wouldn’t be able to help, the daughter said.
“They were basically told no one was coming because they couldn’t reach them,” McIntosh said. “They might be put on a list, and that was it.”
“That’s when we decided to go ahead and tweet the photos, because we were afraid she wasn’t going to get any help,” McIntosh said."

						Can Hurricane Victims Delay Their Mortgage Payments?","Homeowners affected by hurricanes are allowed, under certain circumstances, to delay their mortgage payments.","True
					
						
							About this rating","After hurricanes Harvey and Irma tore through Mexico, the Caribbean, and the southern United States in September 2017, American government agencies and private mortgage companies offered assistance to homeowners needing to delay their mortgage payments.
A spokesperson for the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development, Brian Sullivan, told us on 15 September 2017 that approximately 280,000 Florida homeowners using Federal Housing Administration-insured loans live in counties affected by Hurricane Irma, and that about 220,000 homeowners in parts of Texas damaged by Hurricane Harvey (which made landfall earlier in the month) are currently using FHA loans.
The department has some information on its web site:
If you can’t pay your mortgage because of the disaster, your lender may be able to help you. If you are at risk of losing your home because of the disaster, your lender may stop or delay initiation of foreclosure for 90 days. Lenders may also waive late fees for borrowers who may become delinquent on their loans as a result of the disaster.
FHA borrowers are automatically eligible for a 90-day “foreclosure moratorium”(preventing the start of foreclosure proceedings) in the event of a natural disaster if they or their families live in counties that have been declared a federal disaster area by the government. They are also eligible if:

 They are related to someone who was injured or killed, or reported as missing because of the incident.
 The disaster “directly or substantially affected” their ability to pay their mortgage.

	
		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
HUD also advises:
FHA’s Foreclosure Moratorium only applies to borrowers in default. If you are current, you should continue to make your mortgage payment whenever possible. If, however, you are unable to pay your loan as a result of the disaster, your lender may waive any late fees normally charged and let you know about other options.
If their lender is not able to help them, the agency urges borrowers to contact HUD directly for assistance.
Two private mortgage companies, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, also offer loan deferment programs for customers affected by natural disasters. Borrowers with loans through each company are potentially eligible to pause their mortgage payments for up to 12 months while waiving late fees or risking having a delinquency on their loan reported to credit bureaus.
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau also operates a phone line connecting people unsure whether to pursue forbearance (as the practice of suspending a mortgage payment is known) with counselors from HUD. College students using federally-funded loans who are affected by natural disasters like the two hurricanes are potentially eligible for loan forbearance lasting up to 90 days."

							About this rating","As damage from Hurricane Harvey continued to grow in Texas in late August 2017, some Twitter users sought to defend President Donald Trump’s response to the disaster by criticizing the actions of his predecessor, Barack Obama during similarly pervasive flooding in Louisiana in 2016. Other users took that argument even further, knocking Obama for not “doing enough” to help Louisiana during Hurricane Katrina.
!function(r,u,m,b,l,e){r._Rumble=b,r[b]||(r[b]=function(){(r[b]._=r[b]._||[]).push(arguments);if(r[b]._.length==1){l=u.createElement(m),e=u.getElementsByTagName(m)[0],l.async=1,l.src=”https://rumble.com/embedJS/ucxbq”+(arguments[1].video?’.’+arguments[1].video:”)+”/?url=”+encodeURIComponent(location.href)+”&args=”+encodeURIComponent(JSON.stringify([].slice.apply(arguments))),e.parentNode.insertBefore(l,e)}})}(window, document, “script”, “Rumble”);
 
       Rumble(“play”, {“video”: “v4tygd”,”div”: “rumble_v4tygd”,”autoplay”:2});
The argument that Obama did not do enough after Hurricane Katrina lashed New Orleans, however, ignores the fact that Obama was not president at the time. Katrina made landfall in August 2005, during George W. Bush’s presidency.

Obama — who was a Democratic Party senator representing Illinois when the storm hit — was not elected president until November 2008. However, Obama did meet with Katrina evacuees on 5 September 2005 in Houston, Texas alongside former Presidents Bill Clinton and George H.W. Bush:

Online speculation also mounted around some users posting anti-Obama tweets, questioning whether they were actually Russian misinformation “bots”:
One of the suspected bots, @DaNolans, denied being an illegitimate account in a post on 29 August 2017:
I was taking the piss outta Trump with this folks. Check TL. Never woulda thought people truly believe such nonsense. Scary times #notabot
Ben Nimmo, a senior fellow for information defense for the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research Lab who has written about “bot” attacks, told us that he scanned mentions of Obama and Katrina between 24 August 2017 and 30 August 2017. He said:
The majority of tweets, and the most popular tweets, all mocked the idea of blaming the Katrina reaction on Obama. The anti-Obama messaging does not appear to have penetrated. Of the accounts in the image, one is now suspended and the others show varying degrees of activity; one claims to have been joking. There doesn’t appear to be major bot (i.e. automated) traffic involved.
While it is unclear how many of the recent spate of anti-Obama tweets were manufactured or made in jest, an August 2013 survey conducted by the Democrat-oriented Public Policy Polling showed that 29 percent of Louisiana Republicans believed that Obama was to blame for the oft-criticized federal response to Katrina. Another 44 percent were reportedly unsure whether Obama or George W. Bush was at fault, while 28 percent blamed Bush.
That mindset was brought to national television in a September 2016 segment on Comedy Central’s Daily Show, which featured a Trump supporter who said he believed that Obama “had a big part” in the 9/11 attacks because he was “never in the office” at the time. When asked why Obama would not have been in the Oval Office during the 11 September 2001 attacks (which occurred more than seven years before he was elected president), the man said:
That I don’t know. I’d like to get to the bottom of that."

						Did FEMA Deny Aid to Harvey Victims Unless They Received Vaccinations?","In the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey, FEMA said they would only give aid to victims if they had received (unspecified) vaccinations.","False
					
						
							About this rating","In late August and early September 2017, false rumors began to spread on Facebook and Twitter that FEMA (the Federal Emergency Management Agency) was refusing to give aid to victims of Hurricane Harvey unless they had been vaccinated, and that the agency was forcing people to undergo vaccinations in order to receive aid. 
These rumors are entirely false, and we could not find any iteration of them which provided even a fabricated source or citation. 
On 30 August 2017, Facebook user Percell Velore posted a meme that claimed:
Fema is saying that Texans will have to have a vaccine shot in order to get aid are you paying attention.
Despite including absolutely no evidence whatsoever, the post was shared more than 5,000 times within a few days. 
A search of FEMA’s press releases, Facebook account and Twitter account shows that the agency has not said any such thing. Not only that, but a FEMA spokesperson definitively rejected the rumors in a statement sent to us:
There is absolutely no requirement for Hurricane Survivors to be vaccinated in order to receive assistance from FEMA. They only need to register with FEMA for assistance.  They can do this online at disasterassistance.gov or call 1-800-621-3362.
This is just the latest in a series of false claims surrounding FEMA, and forms part of the long-standing “FEMA camps” conspiracy theory, which holds that the federal government is planning to build concentration camps and impose martial law in the aftermath of a natural disaster."

							About this rating","After torrential flooding hit parts of Texas in the wake of Hurricane Harvey in August 2017, Joel Osteen, the celebrity pastor of Lakewood Church in Houston, was assailed by claims that he had refused to open his megachurch facility to those seeking refuge from floodwaters that had engulfed the city.
On 30 August 2017, the Action News 3 web site published an article reporting that Osteen had finally opened his church to flood victims, but that he was checking tithing records and only taking in (or giving priority to) church members who had made the greatest financial contributions:

Lakewood Church was under fire after apparently not opening up the church to flood victims. The church disputed online criticism, stating “We are prepared to shelter people once the cities and county shelters reach capacity.”
“Victoria and I care deeply about our fellow Houstonians. Lakewood’s doors are open and we are receiving anyone who needs shelter,” Osteen tweeted Tuesday, referencing his wife who is also Lakewood’s co-pastor.
However, on Wednesday, reports from flood victims say the church is following a strict “members only” guideline, taking top church contributors ahead of people on the lower giving scale.
Single mother Tiana Williams said she waited in line for 3 hours, just to be given a numbered ticket and told to check back in a few hours. “When I got to the entrance with my two little boys, they asked for my name and entered it into the computer,” said Williams. “Then, I was told that there were over 2,000 people ahead of me that have reserved beds! When I kept pressuring the guy to tell me why I had to wait, he said they were under strict guidelines to check tithing records of members and number their bed reservations based on their 2016 giving. I just can’t believe this. I just can’t.”

This claim was false, a fabrication that originated with — and was reported only by — the ActionsNews3.com fake news web site.  The only element of the article that was true was that Osteen had issued a tweet the previous day stating that Lakewood Church’s doors were open to those seeking shelter from the storm:

Victoria and I care deeply about our fellow Houstonians. Lakewood’s doors are open and we are receiving anyone who needs shelter.

						Is Trump Rolling Back Clean Water Regulations?",null,null,"After the Trump administration announced “The Navigable Waters Protection Rule” on Jan. 23, 2020, Snopes readers asked us to verify whether the administration was essentially gutting water regulations.
Although it is true the administration’s new rule would sharply curtail protections for streams and wetlands in the U.S., legal challenges and an upcoming presidential election mean the future of the regulation is unclear. The rule was set to go into effect 60 days after being published in the Federal Register on the aforementioned date. A dozen states and New York City are suing to block the rule from taking effect, however.
To help address reader concerns, here’s a closer look at the implications of the new rule.
The Background
Since 1972, the Clean Water Act (CWA) has vested the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers with the power to protect “waters of the United States” from pollution and other environmental harm.
	
		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
Legal challenges to the scope of, or policy changes regarding the interpretation of, the CWA often revolve around the definition of “waters of the United States.” The executive branch has at times issued executive orders on how to interpret the phrase.
In 2015, President Barack Obama issued an executive order that instructed agencies to use a broad definition to increase protections. But in the early months of his administration, Obama’s successor, President Donald Trump, issued an executive order mandating that the EPA and Army Corps review the broader Obama-era interpretation.
Specifically, the order sought to consistently define “waters of the United States” as it appears in two federal rules:







Waters of the United States Rule (WOTUS)
The Navigable Waters Protection Rule







The Trump EPA referred to the assessment and change of the WOTUS rule as “Step 1″ in the agency’s repeal of Obama-era regulations, and issued a final rule that took effect on Dec. 23, 2019.
“Step 2” concerned the definition of “Navigable Waters” as it relates to environmental protection. A final rule on this definition was issued on Jan 23, 2020, and as mentioned earlier was slated to take effect 60 days after the rule’s publication in the Federal Register.
Both of these “steps” serve to loosen restrictions on the CWA by restricting the scope of “waters” that require protection. Here’s how:
What Is the New Rule, Exactly?
According to the EPA, the Trump rule would establish a more limited definition of “waters” regulated by the Clean Water Act in order to outline a more restrictive interpretation of which waters are subject to federal control. In short, the new rule removes federal protections for “ephemeral” streams and wetlands, or seasonal bodies of water that depend on rain or snowfall.		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
Although the new Trump regulation has been couched as a repeal of an Obama-era rule, it goes further than simply undoing the 2015 rule. “That’s a huge rollback from way before Obama, before Reagan,” Blan Holman, a senior attorney with the non-profit Southern Environmental Law Center, told NBC News.
“Ephemeral” waterways are prominent in the “arid west,” or the region of the U.S. where water is more scarce. Those states include “all or portions of 12 states: Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Texas, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming.”
The EPA in 2008 estimated that nearly 81% of streams in six southwest states (Arizona, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah, Colorado, and California) flow only seasonally, meaning they would lose federal protection under the new Trump rule. In New Mexico, the Los Angeles Times reported that 96%  — or nearly all — of the state’s waterways could be affected, and the state does not have its own regulatory framework to fill the void left by the loss of federal protection.
So What Do Those Changes Mean?
As announced in Las Vegas by EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler at the National Association of Home Builders International Builders’ Show in Las Vegas, the new definition “achieves the proper relationship between the federal government and states in managing land and water resources” and “gives states and tribes more flexibility in determining how best to manage their land and water resources while protecting the nation’s navigable waters as intended by Congress when it enacted the Clean Water Act.”
It also means industries like coal mining, oil and gas, real-estate development, and agriculture won’t have to obtain permits to build on or discharge pollutants into ephemeral waterways; and though such waterways flow seasonally instead of year-round, they are still sources of both tap water and recreational bodies of water for downstream communities.
In a statement sent to Snopes, an EPA spokesperson said the 1974 federal Safe Drinking Water Act “lays out the statutory roles and responsibilities for ensuring that our drinking water is safe, and the Navigable Waters Protection Rule does not change that.” Experts told us that while that’s true, the new rule would make ensuring tap water meets quality standards more difficult and, thus, more expensive.
Brett Hartl, government affairs director for the nonprofit environmental advocacy organization Center for Biological Diversity, told us the safety of drinking water wouldn’t ultimately be impacted by the Trump rule change because water utilities are required by law to meet certain standards. But the rule change means that efforts by utilities to purify drinking water would be more difficult and thus more expensive, a cost that would likely be passed on to consumers.		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
“It is true that water quality out of the tap won’t change, but if you swim in a river or a stream, or if you go fishing and you want to eat the fish you catch, that may have more toxic heavy metals in it than before, [and] that is also true,” Hartl told us. “If you care about seeing wildlife along the river, there will be less of it because the rivers will be degraded. There will be costs, but they will just be passed on to people.”
We asked the EPA what steps will be taken to protect clean drinking water and avoid pollution costs being passed on to the public, but we did not receive an answer to this specific question.
What Other Effects Should We Anticipate?
The new rule has been cast as a boon for farmers. But farmers were already exempt from many regulatory hurdles, according to The Associated Press. Instead, real-estate developers “and those in other business sectors [that] take out substantially more permits than farmers for projects impinging on wetlands, creeks and streams […] stand to reap the biggest regulatory and financial relief from the Trump administration’s rollback of wetlands protections.”
Critics argue that the public would be left with polluted recreational waters and higher bills as utilities work harder to purify drinking water; citizens would also foot other costs, critics contend, because flood control would become more difficult and more expensive as wetlands, which act as buffers against floodwaters, would be destroyed.
“What this does is transfer the costs for pollution control and wetland destruction from the perpetrators of that pollution and destruction to the downstream communities who will have to try desperately to compensate for this loss of protection,” said Betsy Southerland, who served as director of the Office of Science and Technology in the EPA’s Office of Water until 2017. “For the downstream communities, their drinking water supplies and recreational waters will experience more pollution, and they’re going to have more flood threats.”
Southerland, a volunteer for the Environmental Protection Network, a nonprofit organization made up of former EPA staff and political appointees, said many states have relied on the federal government’s regulatory system for water protection and don’t have their own system in place to take on the task.
State officials in Arizona, for example, initially estimated 98% of waterways would lose Clean Water Act protection, but they now expect that percentage to be lower. Officials there are reviewing state-level protections for Arizona water losing federal protection. “However, any regulatory authority in the program will have to be approved by the legislature, and the State doesn’t expect a program to be in place until 2023,” said Arizona Department of Environmental Quality Spokesperson Erin Jordan, in an email to Snopes.
Furthermore, Southerland pointed out that 36 states have laws in place that “could restrict the authority of state agencies or localities to regulate waters left unprotected by the federal Clean Water Act.”
The destruction of wetlands could mean an increase in flooding like the 2017 disaster resulting from Hurricane Harvey, in Houston, Texas, said Lacey McCormick, senior communications manager for the conservation non-profit National Wildlife Federation.
“Keeping these wetlands intact is very important for protection from flooding,” McCormick said. “Wetlands are like sponges. They absorb floodwaters. They can also absorb and keep pollutants from flowing downstream into our drinking water. The impacts are obviously quite significant.”
Hartl said he believes the Trump administration is banking on the idea that despite legal challenges to its new rule, a more conservative U.S. Supreme Court will treat the rule-change favorably."

One such video purported to show the massive storm hitting Miami International Airport, but is actually of a completely different weather system (Lidia) at a completely different location (Mexico’s Distrito Federal):

Mexico had offered to send help to victims of Hurricane Harvey, which made landfall in Texas in August 2017 just days before its counterpart Irma hit the Caribbean, but rescinded the offer after a massive earthquake hit its Pacific coast on 8 September 2017, killing dozens and leaving millions of people in Mexico in need of aid."

Origins: On 19 August 2016, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump traveled to Louisiana to survey property damaged by recent flood waters. While Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards warned Trump that this visit should not be turned into a campaign photo-op, the news media managed to snap at least one photograph of Trump unloading a box of Play-Doh brand modeling clay from a truck at the Church International in St. Amant. 
The picture was widely spread on social media and gave many the impression that Trump had donated nothing but Play-Doh to help those who had lost homes to the floods in Louisiana:
<img loading=""lazy"" class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-47246"" src=""https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2016/08/trump-play-doh.jpg"" alt=""trump play-doh"" width=""449"" height=""1200"" data-recalc-dims=""1"" srcset=""https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2016/08/trump-play-doh.jpg?resize=449%2C1200&amp;zoom=1 449w, https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2016/08/trump-play-doh.jpg?resize=449%2C1200&amp;zoom=0.5 225w, https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2016/08/trump-play-doh.jpg?resize=449%2C1200&amp;zoom=0.25 112w"" sizes=""(max-width: 449px) 100vw, 449px"" />
	
		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
The GOP nominee did not at the time issue a press release detailing what items he donated, nor how those donations were funded. (Were these personal donations? Did he collect items from supporters? Did the campaign pay for them?) Regardless, although Trump did donate Play-Doh modeling clay to flood victims in Louisiana, that was not his only donation to those in need, as a video of his helping to unload a truck clearly shows that the donations included much more than just Play-Doh:
 
Play-Doh, diapers, baby formula, various toys, cleaning supplies and socks can be seen in the above-displayed video. A CNN report also noted that Trump had donated blankets and school supplies.
In addition to questioning the contents of Trump’s donation, some were skeptical that the candidate had donated anything at all, claiming that Trump merely helped to unload a truck of supplies donated by another organization. However, CNN and The Creole, the latter an online news source for Ascension Parish in Louisiana, reported that Trump himself had “donated” an 18-wheeler full of supplies:
Trump spent approximately 20-25 minutes inside the command center and asked a lot of questions, according to [St. Amant Fire Chief James E.] LeBlanc. He also donated a 18-wheeler full of supplies and expressed concern for residents, damage to homes, how much water was in the area and if any assistance had been given by the federal government.
A church spokesperson also confirmed that the supplies were donated by Donald Trump:
We are responding to your email inquiring about the video showing Donald Trump unloading supplies at our church. These supplies were donated by Donald Trump.
Although a specific list of donated items was not available, the candidate clearly assisted in providing more than just Play-Doh to the people of Louisiana. 
In August 2017, interest in this item was re-ignited amid debate about the President Trump’s response to Houston flood victims following Hurricane Harvey."

							About this rating","On 4 September 2017, OurLandOfTheFree.com published a story purporting to reveal evidence of a “planned coup” by former U.S. President Barack Obama that had been conveniently exposed by Hurricane Harvey:
A cache of weapons long suspected to be hidden in Texas during Operation Jade Helm 15 was uncovered by the flood waters of Hurricane Harvey. The stockpile, hidden in a small town outside of Lexmar, matches numbers in the inventory reported missing during Obama’s tenure.
Obama and his administration flat out refused to answer where more than 200 million rounds of ammunition went while he was commander-in-chief. The traitor always maintained that there had to be a clerical error. Now that nearly 10 percent of that ammo has been found, little question remains what happened to it.
The story is a fabrication. The site says as much in a disclaimer:
Ourlandofthefree.com makes no guarantee that anything you find here will be based at all in reality. All posts should be considered satirical and all images photoshopped to look like something they’re not. It’s not you, it’s me.
There are other indications as to the story’s nature. For one, there is no record of a town in Texas called “Lexmar”, let alone any “small towns” near it. The story also includes a picture allegedly taken on 4 September 2017 in “Kirkmere, Texas”:
<img loading=""lazy"" class=""size-full wp-image-103044 aligncenter"" style=""border: 1px solid black;"" src=""https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/09/Patriot-Voice-Kirkmere-Picture.jpg"" alt="""" width=""600"" height=""337"" data-recalc-dims=""1"" srcset=""https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/09/Patriot-Voice-Kirkmere-Picture.jpg?resize=600%2C337&amp;zoom=1 600w, https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/09/Patriot-Voice-Kirkmere-Picture.jpg?resize=600%2C337&amp;zoom=0.5 300w, https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/09/Patriot-Voice-Kirkmere-Picture.jpg?resize=600%2C337&amp;zoom=0.25 150w"" sizes=""(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"" />
Again, there is no record of a community by that name in the state. Also, a search for the image reveals that it was taken in May 2010, just outside what has been described as a “Russian ammunition warehouse”:
<img loading=""lazy"" class=""size-full wp-image-103061 aligncenter"" style=""border: 1px solid black;"" src=""https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/09/Russian-ammunition-pic.jpg"" alt="""" width=""600"" height=""407"" data-recalc-dims=""1"" srcset=""https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/09/Russian-ammunition-pic.jpg?resize=600%2C407&amp;zoom=1 600w, https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/09/Russian-ammunition-pic.jpg?resize=600%2C407&amp;zoom=0.5 300w, https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/09/Russian-ammunition-pic.jpg?resize=600%2C407&amp;zoom=0.25 150w"" sizes=""(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"" />
The story also invoked the name of Operation Jade Helm 15, a 2015 United States military exercise that was the focus of several conspiracy theories before it began — but which eventually proceeded without incident. While Our Land of the Free is a “satirical” news site, other sites ran their own versions of the same story, mostly verbatim, but without a disclaimer labeling themselves as fictitious."

As Michael weakened into a tropical storm, internet users and reporters shared extraordinary images of the devastation it caused:

						Did a City in Texas Require Harvey Aid Recipients to Promise Not to Boycott Israel?","As of October 2017, would-be recipients of a repair grant from Dickinson, Texas, must promise not to boycott Israel.","True
					
						
							About this rating","With communities in Texas attempting to recover and rebuild from the devastating effects of Hurricane Harvey in late 2017, an administrative measure taken by one Texas city has attracted national attention. 
Texas Monthly reported:
The city of Dickinson, in Galveston County, was among the hardest-hit places when Hurricane Harvey’s torrential rains slammed Texas. Residents now seeking Harvey relief face a strange ultimatum: agree not to boycott Israel, or your application for aid will be denied. 
The Houston Chronicle wrote:
A recently passed state law prohibits Texas governmental entities — including cities — from contracting with or investing certain public funds in companies that boycott Israel.
“Anti-Israel policies are anti-Texas policies, and we will not tolerate such actions against an important ally,” Gov. Greg Abbott said in a news release earlier this year.
Dickinson’s application for aid to rebuild homes and businesses requires residents to state that they will not boycott Israel during the term of the agreement, according to a form on the city’s website.
	
		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
We received several inquiries from readers wondering about the veracity of these reports. 
As of 24 October 2017, the city of Dickinson, Texas, does indeed require anyone applying for a Hurricane Harvey Repair Grant to promise not to boycott Israel. 
Those seeking a grant are required to sign an agreement with the city of Dickinson “for the purpose of providing funds to assist in rebuilding a home or a business impacted by Hurricane Harvey within the City in a timely manner that will maintain the City’s ad valorem and sales tax revenues, along with other benefits for the City as a whole.”
One of the terms of the application is:
11. Verification not to Boycott Israel. By executing this Agreement below, the Applicant verifies that the Applicant: (1) does not boycott Israel; and (2) will not boycott Israel during the term of this Agreement.
Dickinson Mayor Julie Masters told local TV news channel KHOU that the city was required to include that condition on the release of the funding by a recently-passed Texas state law – House Bill 89, which Governor Greg Abbott signed in May, and which came into effect on 1 September 2017. 
The law states:
A governmental entity may not enter into a contract with a company for goods or services unless the contract contains a written verification from the company that it:
Does not boycott Israel; and
will not boycott Israel during the term of the contract. 		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
Speaking to KHOU, Mayor Masters said:
We had to include that verbiage [from] that statute that was required in that statute…We’re just the messenger – don’t crucify us. We’re just following state law. 
H.B. 89 does not appear to require that any release of public funds come with a commitment by the recipient not to boycott Israel. Rather, it states that Texas (or cities and towns within Texas) cannot enter into a contract with anyone “for goods or services” without adding the “no boycott” clause. 
Under Dickinson’s “repair grant application and agreement,” the city would “provide financial assistance directly” to the recipient for the purpose of repairing and rebuilding private homes and businesses. So it’s unclear how the city receives “goods or services” in return for the grant. 
However, the agreement also defines the grant recipient as an “independent contractor.”
According to KHOU, Masters is set to consult with Texas state officials over the wording of the law. 
The American Civil Liberties Union has criticized both the Dickinson agreement and the state law, saying it was “reminiscent of McCarthy-era loyalty oaths.”
In a statement, ACLU of Texas Legal Director Andre Segura said:
The First Amendment protects Americans’ right to boycott, and the government cannot condition hurricane relief or any other public benefit on a commitment to refrain from protected political expression."

Melania Trump did wear heels — but she wore them in Washington, D.C. as she boarded Air Force One. She changed her shoes on the airplane and wore a pair of sneakers in Texas:

But what a first lady wears to leave the White House, headed to Marine One and then to Air Force One, isn’t usually what she’s wearing when she gets off the plane later.  
By the time Trump arrived in Texas she had changed into white tennis shoes, a white shirt and a black cap with FLOTUS emblazoned on it, and her hair pulled up and off her face. 

The White House released a handful of photographs from the visit, only one of which featured Melania’s shoes. We cropped that photograph to better display her footwear:

						US Unemployment Rate Falls to 49-Year Low of 3.7 Percent",null,"This article is republished here with permission from The Associated Press. This content is shared here because the topic may interest Snopes readers; it does not, however, represent the work of Snopes fact-checkers or editors.","WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. unemployment rate fell to 3.7 percent in September — the lowest level since December 1969 — while hiring slowed.
Employers added just 134,000 jobs, the fewest in a year, the Labor Department said Friday. But that figure was likely lowered by Hurricane Florence.
Florence struck North and South Carolina in the middle of September and closed thousands of businesses. A category that includes restaurants, hotels and casinos lost jobs for the first time since last September, when Hurricane Harvey exerted a similar effect.
Still, September extended the longest streak of hiring on record, with millions of Americans having gone back to work since the Great Recession. Healthy consumer and business spending has been fueling brisk economic growth and emboldening employers to continue hiring. The September gain extended an 8½-year streak of monthly job growth.
Aside from the impact of the storm, the underlying trend in hiring remains strong. Job gains in August and July were revised sharply higher, to show 87,000 more jobs were added. Employers have added a robust 190,000 jobs over the past three months.
	
		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
Last month, average hourly pay increased 2.8 percent from a year earlier, one tick below the year-over-year gain in August.
That figure could rise in the coming months. With the unemployment rate so low, companies are facing intense pressure to boost pay to find the workers they need. Amazon responded on Tuesday by raising its minimum wage to $15 an hour.
Consumers, business executives and most economists remain optimistic. Measures of consumer confidence are at or near their highest levels in 18 years. Retailers have begun scrambling to hire enough workers for what’s expected to be a robust holiday shopping season. A survey of service-sector firms, including banks, hotels and health care providers, found that they are expanding at their fastest pace in a decade.
Americans have continued spending steadily and appear to be in generally stable financial shape. Households are saving nearly 7 percent of their incomes — more than twice the savings rate before the recession. That trend suggests that a brighter economic outlook hasn’t caused consumers to recklessly build up unsustainable debt.
During the April-June quarter, the U.S. economy expanded at a 4.2 percent annual rate, the best in four years. Economists have forecast that growth reached a 3 percent to 3.5 percent annual rate in the July-September quarter.
The economy does show some weak spots. Sales of existing homes have fallen over the past year. Increasingly expensive houses, higher mortgage rates and a shortage of properties for sale are slowing purchases. Auto sales have also slumped.
Other threats loom, too. Borrowing costs for businesses and consumers are rising. Pointing to the economy’s health, the Federal Reserve last week raised the short-term interest rate it controls and predicted that it would continue to tighten credit into 2020 to manage growth and inflation. Over time, higher borrowing costs make auto loans, mortgages and corporate debt more expensive and can eventually slow the economy.
But for now, anticipating stronger growth — and perhaps higher inflation — investors have dumped bonds and forced up their yields. The yield on the government’s 10-year Treasury note, a benchmark for mortgages and other loans, has touched its highest level in seven years.
President Donald Trump’s trade fights could also weigh on the economy, though the effect on hiring won’t likely be felt until next year, economists say. The Trump administration has imposed tariffs on imported steel and aluminum as well as on roughly half of China’s imports to the United Sates. Most U.S. businesses will try to absorb the higher costs themselves, at least for now, economists say, and avoid layoffs.
Still, should the tariffs remain fully in effect a year from now, roughly 300,000 jobs could be lost by then, according to estimates by Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics."

							About this rating","It’s practically inevitable for fake or misleading photographs to circulate in the wake of a major natural disaster. So when images of the destruction from Hurricane Harvey first appeared on social media in late August 2017, many users were wary about which images they could trust.
With that in mind, here is a look at some of the most popular (and misleading) photographs that circulated in the wake of Hurricane Harvey:
Shark Swimming on the Highway?
<img loading=""lazy"" class=""aligncenter wp-image-101942 size-full"" style=""border: 1px solid black;"" src=""https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/08/shark-sighting.jpg"" alt="""" width=""600"" height=""450"" data-recalc-dims=""1"" srcset=""https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/08/shark-sighting.jpg?resize=600%2C450&amp;zoom=1 600w, https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/08/shark-sighting.jpg?resize=600%2C450&amp;zoom=0.5 300w, https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/08/shark-sighting.jpg?resize=600%2C450&amp;zoom=0.25 150w"" sizes=""(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"" />
An image purportedly showing a shark swimming down the highway tends to recirculate on social media after any event involving massive flooding. We first debunked this photograph in 2011 during Hurricane Irene, when it was shared along with the claim that it was taken in Puerto Rico. It popped up again in 2015 after heavy rains in Texas, in 2016 after Hurricane Matthew hit Florida, and, of course, in August 2017 after Hurricane Harvey caused heavy flooding in Houston. 
	
		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
This image, however, is actually a composite of at least two different photographs.
Obama Serves Flood Victims in Texas? 
A 2015 photograph of President Obama ladling food onto a woman’s plate was attached to a 2017 claim that it showed the former President helping with the rescue effort in Texas:
<img loading=""lazy"" class=""aligncenter wp-image-101948"" style=""border: 1px solid black;"" src=""https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/08/obama-food-kitchen.jpg"" alt="""" width=""600"" height=""414"" data-recalc-dims=""1"" srcset=""https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/08/obama-food-kitchen.jpg?resize=555%2C383&amp;zoom=1 555w, https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/08/obama-food-kitchen.jpg?resize=555%2C383&amp;zoom=0.5 278w, https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/08/obama-food-kitchen.jpg?resize=555%2C383&amp;zoom=0.25 139w"" sizes=""(max-width: 555px) 100vw, 555px"" />
The difference between #NotMyPresident &#MyPresident. 
The entire Obama family is in Texas right now serving meals to flood victims. Guess the trumps are too busy going on vacation or playing golf to bother. Do not be surprised when Texas goes blue Republicans. That day is coming soon traitors.
This image is real, but it wasn’t taken in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey. This picture was actually taken over the Thanksgiving holiday in 2015 at a homeless shelter in Washington. 
Houston Airport Flooded?
Although Houston’s airports were flooded during Harvey, things weren’t quite as bad as they appeared in this image:
<img loading=""lazy"" class=""aligncenter wp-image-101951"" style=""border: 1px solid black;"" src=""https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/08/not-houston-airport.jpg"" alt="""" width=""600"" height=""248"" data-recalc-dims=""1"" srcset=""https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/08/not-houston-airport.jpg?resize=720%2C297&amp;zoom=1 720w, https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/08/not-houston-airport.jpg?resize=720%2C297&amp;zoom=0.5 360w, https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/08/not-houston-airport.jpg?resize=720%2C297&amp;zoom=0.25 180w"" sizes=""(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px"" />		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
This image does not show an airport in Houston, nor does it show the impact of Hurricane Harvey. This is a digitally created mockup showing what LaGuardia Airport could look like in a future dramatically affected by climate change:
What LaGuardia Airport could look like at high tide with 5 feet of sea level rise, an amount that could occur by 2100, according to some estimates.
Alligator on the Loose? 
A photograph purportedly showing an alligator on the streets of Houston was shared by journalist Katie Couric, but while it was taken in Houston, the alligator’s appearance is not at all related to the August 2017 floods: 
<img loading=""lazy"" class=""aligncenter wp-image-101957"" style=""border: 1px solid black;"" src=""https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/08/alligator-houston.jpg"" alt="""" width=""600"" height=""573"" data-recalc-dims=""1"" srcset=""https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/08/alligator-houston.jpg?resize=491%2C469&amp;zoom=1 491w, https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/08/alligator-houston.jpg?resize=491%2C469&amp;zoom=0.5 246w, https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/08/alligator-houston.jpg?resize=491%2C469&amp;zoom=0.25 123w"" sizes=""(max-width: 491px) 100vw, 491px"" />

Although this picture was truly taken in Houston, this image is not related to Hurricane Harvey. It was originally snapped in Fort Bend County by Chief Deputy Major Chad Norvell in April 2017. Couric later admitted that she had been “punked”: 

Mmmm. She’s not answering. She lives in Houston but in nyc and someone sent to her…she sent to me-looks like a double punk! ? https://t.co/5RAFW8XJxt

Harvey Loot crew? 		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
An image purportedly showing a store that had been looted in Houston by the #HarveyLootCrew was also circulated online:
<img loading=""lazy"" class=""aligncenter wp-image-102006"" style=""border: 1px solid black;"" src=""https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/08/looters-.jpg"" alt="""" width=""600"" height=""555"" data-recalc-dims=""1"" srcset=""https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/08/looters-.jpg?resize=606%2C561&amp;zoom=1 606w, https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/08/looters-.jpg?resize=606%2C561&amp;zoom=0.5 303w, https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/08/looters-.jpg?resize=606%2C561&amp;zoom=0.25 152w"" sizes=""(max-width: 606px) 100vw, 606px"" />
This image, however, is not related to Hurricane Harvey. It was taken by April O’Brien of the Huffington Post and shows a store that was looted after Hurricane Sandy hit New Jersey in 2012:
Mega Aid Pharmacy: Items were scattered throughout the store, and workers had no idea where or how to begin cleanup.
Fleeing in a Fridge?
A photograph showing three people using a refrigerator as a makeshift boat was also shared as if it were related to Hurricane Harvey:
<img loading=""lazy"" class=""aligncenter wp-image-102014"" style=""border: 1px solid black;"" src=""https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/08/harvey-fridge-boat.jpg"" alt="""" width=""600"" height=""545"" data-recalc-dims=""1"" srcset=""https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/08/harvey-fridge-boat.jpg?resize=580%2C527&amp;zoom=1 580w, https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/08/harvey-fridge-boat.jpg?resize=580%2C527&amp;zoom=0.5 290w, https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/08/harvey-fridge-boat.jpg?resize=580%2C527&amp;zoom=0.25 145w"" sizes=""(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px"" />
This image is real, but it is not related to Hurricane Harvey. It was taken in April 2016 after heavy rains hit the Greenspoint area of Houston:
It was an area hit so hard that families had to escape their homes floating on air mattresses, dads carrying babies in bins, moms and babies riding in refrigerators and others too afraid to trudge through the water took help from strangers while waiting from aid from the City of Houston.		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
Trump Tweet? 
In addition to fake photographs, we also saw at least one fake tweet supposedly sent by President Trump:
<img loading=""lazy"" class=""aligncenter wp-image-102027"" style=""border: 1px solid black;"" src=""https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/08/trump-tweet-harvey.jpg"" alt="""" width=""600"" height=""304"" data-recalc-dims=""1"" srcset=""https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/08/trump-tweet-harvey.jpg?resize=960%2C487&amp;zoom=1 960w, https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/08/trump-tweet-harvey.jpg?resize=960%2C487&amp;zoom=0.5 480w, https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/08/trump-tweet-harvey.jpg?resize=960%2C487&amp;zoom=0.25 240w"" sizes=""(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px"" />

This tweet does not appear on Trump’s timeline, nor is it included in any of the various databases which archive tweets deleted by the president. This fake tweet was most likely created with a “tweet generator” in an attempt to mock some of the president’s genuine tweets (which some critics called “bombastic“) about the hurricane. In fact, this fake tweet could be considered a more exaggerated version of the following (genuine) messages:

Wow – Now experts are calling #Harvey a once in 500 year flood! We have an all out effort going, and going well!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 27, 2017


I will also be going to a wonderful state, Missouri, that I won by a lot in ’16. Dem C.M. is opposed to big tax cuts. Republican will win S!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 27, 2017


I will be going to Texas as soon as that trip can be made without causing disruption. The focus must be life and safety.
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 27, 2017

Hurricane Harvey?
Although most of the fake Hurricane Harvey photographs we encountered focused on the flood waters, we came across one that purportedly showed the storm as it approached the shore:

<img loading=""lazy"" class=""aligncenter wp-image-102038"" style=""border: 1px solid black;"" src=""https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/08/hurricane-harvey.jpg"" alt="""" width=""600"" height=""628"" data-recalc-dims=""1"" srcset=""https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/08/hurricane-harvey.jpg?resize=487%2C510&amp;zoom=1 487w, https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/08/hurricane-harvey.jpg?resize=487%2C510&amp;zoom=0.5 244w, https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/08/hurricane-harvey.jpg?resize=487%2C510&amp;zoom=0.25 122w"" sizes=""(max-width: 487px) 100vw, 487px"" />

This image does not show Hurricane Harvey. It has been circulating since at least 2003 (when it was shared as an image of Hurricane Isabel) and is possibly a digital creation."

						‘Cancelled’ ICE Raid Raises Questions About Potentially Massive Operation",null,null,"Just days after NBC News reported that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) was planning a massive deportation operation (dubbed “Operation Mega”) for late September 2017 targeting 6,000 to 10,000 undocumented people, ICE released a statement announcing the operation had been cancelled due to catastrophic weather conditions brought on by Hurricanes Harvey and Irma.
In a statement sent to us by email the agency maintained “there is currently no coordinated nationwide operation planned for mid-September.” But both the massive scale of the the aptly-named “Mega” operation and the abrupt cancellation following its revelation in the news through a leaked memo prompted immigrant advocates to question why such a massive operation was scheduled when southern border crossings are at record lows.
Pedro Rios, director of the San Diego office of American Friends Service Committee, a Quaker social justice organization, told us the scope of the operation points to the potential for escalation under a president who started his campaign expressing hostility toward immigrants. For one thing, Rios said, an operation that size is unheard of in recent history which could be a harbinger for things to come:
I don’t remember any operation that was targeting so many people at one time — certainly there were some targeting a couple thousand, but never 8,400 to 10,000 people. When [Attorney General] Jeff Sessions was giving his speech about DACA, he did allude to other things like limiting legal migration as well. So the possibility for further action by the government to target people is definitely a concern.
Enrique Morones, founder of the migrant aid group Border Angels, told us that, despite the cancellation announcement, he doesn’t know what’s going to happen — but rumors are flying, creating heightened fear in the community.
People are on pins and needles, and even if they see law enforcement show up for something which could be unrelated, they think it could be a raid. I don’t know if there’s going to be one or not.
	
		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
In a statement released to reporters, ICE officials said:
Due to the current weather situation in Florida and other potentially impacted areas, along with the ongoing recovery in Texas, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) had already reviewed all upcoming operations and has adjusted accordingly. There is currently no coordinated nationwide operation planned at this time. The priority in the affected areas should remain focused on life-saving and life-sustaining activities.
When we asked for clarification, we received a similarly-worded statement:
[T]here is currently no coordinated nationwide operation planned for mid-September. However, as the statement also makes clear, ICE fugitive operations teams will continue to target and arrest criminal aliens and other individuals who are in violation of our nation’s immigration laws, in non-affected areas of the country, as part of routine operations.
Morones said the wording of the statement left it unclear as to whether aspects of the operation could proceed so long as they were not coordinated nationwide.
Rios told us the Obama administration discouraged “collateral arrests,” or the detention of people encountered by ICE by chance, and who may not be documented but don’t have any criminal records at all. That approach has changed, Rios told us. Although ICE’s public statements seemed to give the impression the agency continues to prioritize those with criminal backgrounds, an official who spoke to NBC News said the operation could result in collateral arrests.
Although it’s unclear whether those captured in any potential raids would be immediately deported, Detention Watch Network policy director Mary Smalls told us ICE has the capacity to detain as many as 42,000 people on any given day due to contracts with mostly-private detention facilities — and many of those contracts include wording that requires a minimum number of detainees to fill beds. But with southern border crossings down to record lows in 2017, Smalls said ICE has had to be more aggressive with raids and detentions in the country’s interior to make up for the decline.
Smalls told us that case-in-point, 70 percent of the people caught up in a July 2017 sweep, which was the second phase of an operation known as “Border Guardian/Border Resolve” were “collateral” arrests — a pattern advocates fear will continue. Smalls told us:
What is written into a lot of these facility contracts is a guarantee that a certain number of people will be detained and if not, ICE will pay them as though they are. The fact the whole thing is based off of a quota system tells you that this is not a self-restraining system. This is a system that’s going to go after as many people as it can."

						Did a 2005 Movie Feature Hurricanes Named Harvey and Irma?",The 2005 movie Category 7: The End of the World predicted the arrival of hurricanes named Harvey and Irma.,"False
					
						
							About this rating","In September 2017, rumors emerged on social media that a 2005 movie predicted current events by featuring two hurricanes named Harvey and Irma — and that this somehow proved that the hurricanes were both human-engineered.
A typical viral message read as follows:
11 years and 9 months ago a movie came out called “Category 7 End of the World” and there were only two episodes called “Harvey” and “Irma”! Read that over a few times until it sinks in! These are NOT “storms”, but predictive program attacks on the American people that they told “U.S.” about in the Hollywood black magic ritual of telling their victims exactly how you intend to take their lives.
The second hurricane called IRMA in the movie struck the United States on 9/11, and guess when this storm is suppose to hit “U.S.”? This is way too much of a “coincidence” for even the casual observer to ignore. 
Category 7: End of the World was a two-part made-for-TV movie broadcast by CBS in November 2005. It’s an apocalyptic thriller directed by Dick Lowry and starring Shannon Doherty about a series of extreme weather events that cause destruction around the world.
In the movie, a hurricane named Eduardo strikes Florida and Washington, D.C., while an unnamed Category 6 storm hits New York. Eventually the two combine, causing the movie’s eponymous Category 7 storm, which threatens a global catastrophe. 
	
		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
None of the storms or hurricanes in the movie was named Harvey or Irma. Furthermore, Category 7: End of the World was broadcast in November 2005, which was 11 years and 10 months (not nine months) before Hurricane Irma’s expected landfall in Florida on 10 September 2017. So the meme’s two key claims were false. 
However, even if these claims were accurate, they would have no sinister meaning. 
Atlantic hurricanes are named from a prescribed list of names that are rotated every six years and published in advance. So we already know the list of potential hurricane names for 2018, 2019, and every year for the foreseeable future, unless they are changed by the World Meteorological Association. 
There was a Hurricane Harvey, for example, in 2011 and a Tropical Storm Harvey in 2005 and 1999. Had the filmmakers named their fictional storms Harvey or Irma, they could easily have chosen them from the same publicly available list.
Even if there had been 11 years and 9 months between the original broadcast of Category 7: End of the World, and Hurricane Irma’s expected landfall, this would be a meaningless coincidence.
To believe otherwise requires believing a vast, unfeasibly complicated conspiracy theory involving the movie’s writers, directors, CBS, and the federal government, who would then have to engineer and manage a tropical storm into a powerful hurricane (something that is impossible) and time its development to perfection so that it makes landfall in the United States on 11 September 2017 exactly.
In reality, Hurricane Irma is expected to hit the continental U.S. on 10 September 2017. 
However, again, even if the post had gotten the dates right, the idea that they contain significance is an example of cherry-picking numerical patterns (which exist everywhere) and contorting them to fit pre-existing beliefs and theories. We have addressed such pattern-seeking previously, in the context of both hurricanes and terrorist attacks.
The “Category 7” meme consists of a ludicrous conspiracy theory based on evidence-free claims about government “geoengineering” and numerology, and ignores the fact that hurricane names are made public years in advance. Furthermore, its two key factual claims – that the hurricanes in the movie were named Harvey and Irma, and that the movie was released 11 years and nine months ago – are false."

							About this rating","The California wildfires of October 2017 have prompted a series of articles falsely blaming immigrants and Muslims for starting them. 
On 19 October 2017, the “satirical” web site Freedom Junkshun published the completely fabricated claim that police in California had arrested Muhammad Islam, a 23-year-old Iranian immigrant.
The California wildfires devastated the northern part of the state. Police initially arrested one suspect but released him after an investigation was conducted because the investigation led them to the actual person responsible for the fires: a 23-year-old man named Muhammad Islam.
Islam was born in Tehran, Iran and came to the United States in 2015 on a student visa, which expired when he dropped out of Dartmouth in November 2016.
None of these details are based in fact, and the Fox News report mentioned in the article also does not exist. The photograph used in the article actually shows Omar El-Abed, a 19-year-old Palestinian man accused of murdering a Jewish family in the West Bank in July 2017.
Another article on Freedom Junkshun falsely claims that the fictional Muhammad Islam was seen burning the American flag at a protest in Berkeley, California.
	
		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
On 17 October 2017, the right-wing web site Breitbart falsely linked the arrest of Jesus Fabian Gonzalez in Sonoma County, California, with the wildfires.
The article, which was republished by conspiracy theorist Alex Jones’s web site Infowars, falsely described Gonzalez as having been detained in connection with the wildfires, claiming he was “arrested Sunday on suspicion of arson in Wine Country fires that have killed at least 40 residents.”
Sonoma County Sheriff Rob Giordano directly refuted these claims in a press conference later that day. The relevant section of the video starts at 12.10:
I want to talk about something, there’s a little rumor control issue. The Sonoma County Sheriff’s Office arrested a man on Sunday [15 October] for arson, in Maxwell Park in Sonoma. There’s a story out there that he’s the arsonist for these fires – that is not the case. There is no indication he is related to these fires at all.
…Our arson case involves someone who’s known to the deputies, he frequents Maxwell Park, he’s been known to sleep there, he was walking away from…a small fire, they stopped him. He had a fire extinguisher and a lighter with him. They asked him if he started the fire [in Maxwell Park], he said he started the fire to warm himself up, something to that effect.
Giordano added that he wanted to “kill that speculation right now,” referring to reports that Gonzalez’s arrest was related to the wildfires.
Remarkably, something of a war of words has broken out between the Sonoma County Sheriff’s Office and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) over Gonzalez’s arrest. ICE says that Gonzalez is an undocumented immigrant.
On 18 October, ICE issued a press release criticizing the sheriff’s office and claiming that it had lodged a “detainer” against Gonzalez (asked the county to detain him for up to 48 hours after his scheduled release date, in order to make a determination about a possible deportation).
Once again, a non-cooperative jurisdiction has left their community vulnerable to dangerous individuals and preventable crimes. ICE lodged a detainer against Jesus Gonzalez with Sonoma County jail officials on October 16, following his arrest on felony charges for maliciously setting fire to a property. This is especially troubling in light of the massive wildfires already devastating the region.
Over the past year, ICE has lodged detainers against Mr. Gonzalez after four separate arrests by Sonoma County on various felony and misdemeanor charges. ICE was never notified of Mr. Gonzalez’ various releases. Additionally, Mr. Gonzales has been returned to his home country of Mexico on two separate occasions. The residents of Sonoma County, and the state of California, deserve better than policies that expose them to avoidable dangers. Non-cooperation policies – now enshrined in California state law – ensure only one thing: criminals who would otherwise be deported will be released and left free to reoffend as they please.		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
The following day, Sheriff Giordano hit back. In a message posted to Facebook, he said the detainer request was not signed by a judge and was unconstitutional, and said ICE’s press release had been “misleading” and caused fear during a major natural disaster.
The US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) issued a press release yesterday that was inaccurate, inflammatory, and damages the relationship we have with our community…ICE sent a detainer requesting the Sheriff’s Office hold Gonzalez for 48 hours past his scheduled release time. However, this detainer is not signed by a judge so the Sheriff’s Office cannot legally honor it. Multiple Federal court cases have determined these administrative detainers are unconstitutional.
…Gonzalez has been in our jail approximately 8 times for minor misdemeanor offenses. We have notified ICE about his release in several of those arrests as they took place before our recent policy change. We will continue to notify ICE if it complies with law and our policy. But as I stated earlier, they can seek a warrant and we will hold him.
ICE attacked the Sheriff’s Office in the midst of the largest natural disaster this county has ever experienced. Tens of thousands of people have been evacuated, many people have lost their homes and 23 people have died from this firestorm. ICE’s misleading statement stirs fear in some of our community members who are already exhausted and scared.
Earlier in the month, the Got News web site published an unsubstantiated claim that senior law enforcement officials believed that Mexican drug cartels — seeking a strategic advantage over the nascent legal marijuana industry — were responsible for the wildfires, which had destroyed a significant portion of cannabis farmland.
That deeply flawed article was seized upon by web sites such as Proud Patriots, which almost gleefully reported:
President Donald Trump was absolutely right once again. His predictions seem to be true and the US people have one huge reason why should they join the legal battle against DRUGS in the USA and the providers of those drugs – the illegal immigrants and the narco cartels. 
This trend of blaming certain societal groups (in these examples, immigrants and Muslims) for disasters and tragedies — both natural and man-made — and seeking out evidence of their culpability, however spurious, is nothing new.
Throughout Europe in the 14th Century, Jews were scapegoated and blamed for causing the Black Death. They faced widespread and intensified persecution and violence as a result.
The televangelist Jerry Falwell blamed the 9/11 terrorist attacks on “the pagans, and the abortionists, and the feminists, and the gays and the lesbians.” He later apologized.
In 2015, a Malaysian state government official blamed Western tourists for an earthquake, and over the years, the LGBT community has been the target of consistent scapegoating in the United States, particularly on behalf of Christian clergy. Most recently, a number of pastors and ministers blamed Hurricane Harvey on the LGBT community."

						Were Houston Residents Warned to Use Gas Masks During Mosquito Spraying?","In September 2017, authorities in Houston, Texas warned residents to use gas masks as they sprayed the area with a neurotoxic insecticide that ""causes brain damage"".","Mostly False
					
						
							About this rating","In September 2017, the “Stranger Than Fiction News” Facebook page claimed in a post and video that authorities in Houston, Texas had warned residents to put on gas masks while aircraft sprayed for mosquitoes in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey: 
HOUSTON WARNS RESIDENTS TO USE GAS MASKS AS C-130 GUNSHIPS RAIN DOWN TOXIC SPRAY IN FIGHT AGAINST MOSQUITOS.
The video features graphics (edited to look like those used in authentic news reports) which read: “Breaking news: Houston to spray neurotoxin for mosquito control.” In the video, a local news broadcast is edited so that a narrator’s voice claims that aircraft are “spraying neurotoxins everywhere”:
What makes this worse is that the neurotoxin they’re using — naled — is banned in the European Union and other countries because it’s a known neurotoxin that causes brain damage.
Authorities in Harris County, Texas did schedule mosquito spraying during the week of 14 September 2017, and they did sanction the use of naled, which is not allowed for use as a pesticide in the European Union but is authorized for use in the United States.
	
		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
The process by which the European Union and the United States review potential risk from chemicals differs, and often times results in conflicting assessments. In the European Union, naled is not authorized for use as a pesticide; it carries warning labels indicating that it is a toxin and an irritant, though these effects occur at higher concentrations than would be expected from mosquito spraying.
On 13 September 2017, the Harris County Department of Public Health announced that a program of aerial spraying would begin the following day in order to counteract the risk posed by mosquitoes, which had been present in unusually large numbers in the surface water left behind by Hurricane Harvey:
The rain left behind by Hurricane Harvey has created large areas in Harris County where mosquitoes can lay their eggs. To address increasing numbers of mosquitoes and the risk they pose to the recovery effort and public health, the U.S. Air Force Reserve’s 910th Airlift Wing flying modified C-130 cargo planes staged out of Kelly Air Force Base in San Antonio will be conducting an aerial spray operation beginning Thursday evening, September 14 and may take more than one day. The plan is to spray approximately 600,000 acres by air, weather permitting.
A spokesperson for the Harris County Department of Public Health told us that the spraying was officially scheduled to continue through 20 September 2017. The announcement continues:
…The insecticide, Dibrom (EPA-approved), is routinely used for aerial spray operations to combat mosquito-borne disease and will be used during the spray operation in Harris County. Dibrom is considered safe for the environment and is applied by licensed applicators, according to the label instructions. 
Dibrom is a brand name for naled, the chemical highlighted in the Stranger Than Fiction Facebook video. The federal Environment Protection Agency (EPA) says of naled:
When applied according to label instructions, EPA does not expect the use of naled for public health mosquito control to raise a human health concern. People are unlikely to breathe in amounts large enough or touch anything with enough insecticide on it to harm them. However, anyone who is concerned because of an existing health problem should talk to their doctor. Also, people who tend to be sensitive to chemicals in general, including household chemicals, could experience short-term effects, such as skin, eye, and nose irritation. 
Naled’s classification as a neurotoxin stems from its ability to cause cholinesterase depression, a harmful lowering of the levels of cholinesterase, an enzyme important to the functioning of nervous system. (In fact, that’s how naled works: it lowers cholinesterase in insects to a level that proves fatal to them.) Again, these effects — which have primarily been investigated using animal studies — are not relevant to the concentrations found during mosquito spraying. 		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
The primary research on pesticides and cholinesterase depression in humans revolves around farmworkers or other groups who are exposed to pesticides on a daily basis, and at much higher concentrations than the “ultra low-volume” mist involved in aerial mosquito spraying, especially by the time that spray reaches the ground. An Environmental Protection Agency spokesperson told us that they have taken the risks into consideration:

EPA has estimated the exposure and risk to both adults and children posed by ultra-low volume aerial and ground application of naled. Because of the very small amount of active ingredient released per acre of ground, exposures were below an amount that might pose a health concern. These estimates assumed several spraying events over a period of weeks, and also assumed that a toddler would consume some soil and grass in addition to skin and inhalation exposure. 
Because naled is applied at ultra-low volumes, low rates and does not persist in the environment, when applied according to label instructions, EPA does not expect the use of naled for public health mosquito control to raise a human health concern. People are unlikely to breathe in amounts large enough or touch anything with enough insecticide on it to harm them.

Dr Jeffrey G. Scott, a professor of entomology at Cornell University, told us:
Under normal circumstances it would not be expected that a person would be able to pick up a lethal dose in a treated area.
On the whole, the claims made in the “Stranger Than Fiction” video (seeking as it does to warn viewers that authorities in Houston, Texas are spraying a “deadly” neurotoxin that “causes brain damage”) are mostly false. It’s true that the Harris County Department of Public Health, in collaboration with the United States Air Force, did spray naled over the county in September 2017, and naled is an organophosphate pesticide which kills insects by lethally suppressing their nervous system (i.e. is a neurotoxin).
However, authorities in Harris County did not warn residents to wear gas masks during spraying, and the risk of neurotoxic damage to humans is largely limited to close exposure to naled in high concentrations — not the type of exposure expected in aerial spraying, which uses naled at an “ultra-low volume” and involves significant dissipation of the chemical by the time it reaches the ground."

						Did Jennifer Lawrence Say Hurricanes Are ‘Nature’s Wrath’ Against Trump?",Actress Jennifer Lawrence blamed recent hurricanes in the U.S. on President Trump.,"False
					
						
							About this rating","In September 2017, right-wing websites accused actress Jennifer Lawrence of blaming President Trump for the deadly hurricanes that recently ravaged several Caribbean nations along with Texas and Florida.
Newsbusters, for example, reported that Lawrence said “‘Mother Nature’s Rage’ Directed at U.S. Because of Trump.” Two days later, Fox News host Tucker Carlson dedicated a segment to Lawrence’s purported comments with an accompanying online article headline that reads, “Tucker Slams ‘Out of Touch’ Jennifer Lawrence for Linking Hurricanes to Trump.” In the segment, Carlson and his guest poke fun at Lawrence for suffering from what they call “Trump Derangement Syndrome.”
The false rumor is a twisted version of comments that Lawrence made during an interview on British television to promote her new movie Mother!, a psychological thriller that uses climate change as a central metaphor. 
During the interview, Lawrence said science has demonstrated that climate change is the result of human activity. When prompted by the interviewer, she added that she was troubled by the 2016 presidential election results. She never mentioned President Trump by name in that interview, but within hours various publications were sensationalizing it with commentary claiming the actress blamed him for hurricanes Harvey and Irma, which struck southeast Texas and Florida in late August and early September.
It didn’t take long for the rumor to spread to more traditionally mainstream publications like the New York Daily News and celebrity site Us Weekly, which put the false claim in their headlines. The British publication The Independent further took liberties with the actress’s comments by reporting, inaccurately:
Jennifer Lawrence has suggested that it is difficult not to feel as though the devastating hurricanes in Texas and approaching Florida are signs of “Mother Nature’s rage and wrath” at America for electing Donald Trump.
	
		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
The Independent story has an even more misleading headline if one sees it in a Google search result:
<img loading=""lazy"" class=""aligncenter wp-image-103500 size-full"" style=""border: 1px solid black;"" src=""https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/09/a.jpg"" alt="""" width=""600"" height=""118"" data-recalc-dims=""1"" srcset=""https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/09/a.jpg?resize=600%2C118&amp;zoom=1 600w, https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/09/a.jpg?resize=600%2C118&amp;zoom=0.5 300w, https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/09/a.jpg?resize=600%2C118&amp;zoom=0.25 150w"" sizes=""(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"" />
Here is a transcript of the actual exchange:
Long: When the director was asked about the film, why it was so dark, he said, “It’s a mad time to be alive.” And there’s certainly a sort of end-of-days feeling about it. For many people in America who would say perhaps it’s true there at the moment than anywhere else. I mean what are your thoughts about the changes that have happened in your own country over the last year or so?
Lawrence: It’s scary, you know, it’s this new language that’s forming. I don’t even recognize it. It’s also scary to know — it’s been proven through science that human activity — that climate change is due to human activity and we continue to ignore it and the only voice that we really have is through voting. Um, so —
Long: And you have voted —
Lawrence: And we voted, and it was really startling. You know, you’re watching these hurricanes now, and it’s really — it’s hard, especially while promoting this movie not to feel Mother Nature’s rage, or wrath.
On 10 September 2017, Lawrence herself responded to the controversy on her official Facebook page, writing:
My remarks were taken grossly out of context. Obviously I never claimed that President Trump was responsible for these tragic hurricanes. That is a silly and preposterous headline that is unfortunate, because it detracts from the millions of lives that are being impacted by these devastating storms and the recent earthquake. What is really important is focusing on the ways we can help. My heart is with everyone affected and the brave first responders who are working to keep us all safe. Please join me in donating to:

United Way of Houston https://www.unitedwayhouston.org

Save The Children www.savethechildren.org

Americares https://www.americares.org
During the interview, Lawrence did express sadness in the failure to adequately address climate change and environmental degradation and said that the power to do so comes from Americans’ ability to vote for their elected leaders.
President Trump has been on the record denying climate change and has selected fellow climate change deniers to head key agencies such as the EPA and NASA. However, although Lawrence has made it no secret she is not a supporter of the president, she didn’t blame him for the recent hurricanes."

This content is shared here because the topic may interest Snopes readers; it does not, however, represent the work of Snopes fact-checkers or editors.","HOUSTON (AP) — The gymnasium at the Champions Islamic Center is covered with mats and blankets, donated clothes and boxes of food lining its walls.
On the eve of the Eid al-Adha festival, one of Islam’s holiest days, it’s become the temporary home for 15 of the thousands of Harvey evacuees, Muslim and non-Muslim. And though it will host hundreds of people during the Friday morning prayer for the so-called festival of sacrifice, the mosque’s leaders have been adamant: No matter how many people attend the prayers, the evacuees aren’t going anywhere.
“They are the No. 1 priority. They will not be disturbed, they will not be displaced, they will not be moved,” said M.J. Khan, the president of the Islamic Society of Greater Houston, which operates the Champions mosque and several others that are providing shelter. “People who come, if they have to pray in the parking lot, they’ll pray in the parking lot.”
As in other catastrophes, from Superstorm Sandy in October 2012 to Hurricane Katrina in 2005, and the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, American Muslims have been counted both as victims and as participants in the recovery. Houston’s Muslim community, an estimated 200,000 people, has opened many of its community centers and sent hundreds of volunteers to serve food and deliver donations. Some have rescued neighbors from high water.
Despite Harvey’s historic flooding hitting the Houston area just days ago, the rituals of fasting, an iftar dinner and prayers continue at the Champions mosque, also known as Masjid al-Salam, and other community centers in Houston. But some families who participate in those rituals will spend the night at a mosque because they can’t return to their homes. Others will head from prayers Friday morning to volunteer at food banks and shelters. Still others find themselves at one of the city’s mega-shelters, unable to get to a mosque for the holiday.
	
		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
Islamic leaders and scholars say the work underscores the spirit of the festival, which coincides with the hajj, or pilgrimage to the Islamic holy city of Mecca, Saudi Arabia. Muslims slaughter livestock and distribute the meat to the poor, commemorating the willingness of the Prophet Ibrahim — also known as Abraham to Christians and Jews — to sacrifice his son in accordance with God’s will, though in the end God provides him a sheep to sacrifice instead.
“The ultimate goal of holding and practicing all of these rituals … is to help others,” said Imam Hassan Qazwini, leader of a Detroit-area mosque and one of the top Shiite Muslim leaders in the United States. His mosque, the Islamic Institute of America, is dedicating this Eid to raising money for storm victims, and state and national Islamic organizations also have been spearheading similar efforts.
“I believe opening your door on the day of Eid for refugees and people in need is a form of worship itself,” he said.
Sitting in a chair inside the Champions mosque’s gymnasium, Mabel Rozier recounted how she was rescued from her third-floor apartment as the floods outside reached the second floor. A sheriff’s deputy dropped her at the mosque, which at its peak took in around 35 people.
Rozier she said she was grateful to have a comfortable place to eat and sleep while she waited to return home.
“Muslims are just like any other type of person. They’re caring, loving, giving people,” said Katherine McCusker, also staying in the gymnasium. “I feel very fortunate that they were open and willing to come and have this space.”
At the George R. Brown Convention Center, which gave shelter to around 10,000 people at its peak, a handful of Muslim evacuees were organizing a small Eid prayer for Friday.
Hasan Logan, 33, has been meeting with other Muslims during the several days they’ve stayed inside the convention center, sometimes blocking off a small prayer space with chairs and their shoes.		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
“It’s going to be hard (observing Eid), but I’m going to do it,” Logan said.
Nearby, Ismail and Rabia Vaid were volunteering with the American Red Cross, which has run the shelter and expanded it as it doubled its original 5,000-person capacity. For several nights after their shifts ended, they slept in cots set aside for volunteers and then returned to do more.
“It’s not about religion,” Ismail Vaid said. “When a problem or chaos happens — whether it’s natural or man-made — as a Muslim and as humanity, we have to participate.”
Liyakat Takim, a professor of global Islam at McMaster University in the Canadian city of Hamilton, Ontario, said what’s happening in Houston is the best example of Islam in action — and what is most important to the faith.
“Muslims are very much part of American society and they should contribute in any way possible,” he said. “If you cannot be a good human being, you cannot be a good Muslim. … The primary identity is not as a Muslim — the primary identity is humanity.”

						Puerto Rican Hurricane Disaster Reignites Debate Over U.S. Shipping Law",null,null,"An outcry for federal assistance for Puerto Rico in the wake of a devastating September 2017 hurricane that spurred criticism from lawmakers has effectively suspended a 1920 law restricting maritime shipments to the island.
The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has refused requests to waive the provisions of the Merchant Marine Act of 1920 (also known as the Jones Act) in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria, which has reportedly already killed at least 44 people — including 16 in Puerto Rico — and left nearly all of the territory’s 3.4 million residents without electrical power since making landfall on 20 September 2017.
Puerto Rican Gov. Ricardo Rossello said on 27 September 2017 that he expects DHS to issue a waiver on the law, which requires that any shipments to U.S. territories like Guam and Puerto Rico — as well as non-mainland states like Alaska and Hawaii — be carried out by vessels that are not only owned by Americans, but based in the U.S. and maintaining a crew of U.S. citizens or permanent residents.
But a DHS spokesperson, David Lapan, told us that the circumstances surrounding Puerto Rico are different than the ones that led the agency to issue and extend a waiver on the law earlier in the month following the damage done in mainland U.S. states by Hurricanes Harvey and Irma.
Lapan said in a statement:
The fuel concerns associated with Hurricane Harvey were driven by the loss of numerous refineries and the shutdown of the primary pipeline moving refined fuel to the East Coast and Southeast. In those cases, we needed additional vessel capacity to make up for those loses. We do not lack US-flagged vessel capacity to move commodities to Puerto Rico, and restrictions on port operations and slowdowns at the port (e.g., cranes operating on generators are moving at half speed), and the above mentioned internal movement of goods, will be the primary limiting factors.
	
		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
As of 27 September 2017, Lapan told us, four ports in the territory were open, though not operational at full capacity. Another five were open “with restrictions,” while the rest of the local ports were still undergoing a federal assessment.
Two federal agencies, U.S Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) have dispatched aid to Puerto Rico.
But various lawmakers have criticized the federal government’s response. A group of Democratic House members called for a one-year suspension of the Jones Act in order to better allow supplies to be delivered by sea to Puerto Rico. Rep. Nydia M. Velázquez (D-New York) said in a statement that the hurricane was “a natural disaster of historic proportions.” Another lawmaker, Rep. Luis V. Gutiérrez (D-Illinois), said:
Puerto Rico is broke and the federal government already controls the purse strings through the financial control board or Junta that was imposed by Congress. Puerto Rico can’t borrow funds and they are required to use American shipping only, which is the most expensive in the world. In their hour of need, Washington can help by suspending the Jones Act and suspending cost-sharing obligations. Puerto Rico was closing schools and hospitals and laying off cops before the two hurricanes hit this month, so Washington should go these extra steps.
Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona — who introduced a bill in July 2017 calling for the law to be repealed — released a statement on 26 September 2017 saying that he was “very concerned” by DHS’s decision not to grant Puerto Rico the same waiver against the law that Texas, Florida, and Louisiana received. He said:
It is unacceptable to force the people of Puerto Rico to pay at least twice as much for food, clean drinking water, supplies and infrastructure due to Jones Act requirements as they work to recover from this disaster. Now, more than ever, it is time to realize the devastating effect of this policy and implement a full repeal of this archaic and burdensome Act.
The Federal Reserve Bank of New York said in a 2014 report that granting Puerto Rico a five-year waiver from the Jones Act would help determine whether its restrictions contributed to the “substantial burden” caused by the high cost of shipping there.
However, the American Maritime Partnership — an advocacy group comprised of workers’ groups, contractors, and other organizations tied to the shipbuilding industry — has argued that the law is “critical to our country’s economic surgery”:
The 40,000 Jones Act vessels operating in the domestic trades support nearly 500,000 American jobs and almost $100 billion in annual economic impact. An impressive five indirect jobs are created for every one direct maritime job, which results in more than $28 billion in labor compensation. The industry moves close to 888 million tons of cargo every year, which plays an important role in relieving congestion on the nation’s crowded roads and railways.
On 28 September 2017, the Trump administration announced that it was waiving the Jones Act effective immediately at the behest of Puerto Rico’s governor:

At @ricardorossello request, @POTUS has authorized the Jones Act be waived for Puerto Rico. It will go into effect immediately.

						Was Joel Osteen’s Houston ‘Megachurch’ Affected By Hurricane Harvey?","Joel Osteen's Lakewood Church in Houston is ""inaccessible"" because of flooding caused by Hurricane Harvey.","Mixture
					
						
							About this rating","In August 2017, just after Hurricane Harvey made landfall and inundated Houston with record rainfall and flooding, celebrity pastor Joel Osteen’s Lakewood Church, which is based in the region, drew criticism for not making itself available to people affected by the storm.
On 27 August, the church posted:
Dear Houstonians! Lakewood Church is inaccessible due to severe flooding! We want to help make sure you are safe. Please see the list below for safe shelters around our city, and please share this with those in need!
A day later, a post on Lakewood’s blog read, in part:
Over the last couple of days, as the enormity of this storm was being realized, we have been working to organize relief efforts for the Houston area with our friend Franklin Graham and the disaster relief organization that he oversees, Samaritan’s Purse. Samaritan’s Purse has been, since it’s inception, organized to respond to situations just like Hurricane Harvey, and we are grateful to be able to partner with them to provide assistance to the Houston area.
We know the need is great. That much is clear. We do not yet know all the ways we can help.
	
		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
The church reportedly seats more than 16,000 people.
Osteen, whose own Houston home is worth a reported $10.5 million, has not made any comments regarding possible flooding near the church. A map of the area surrounding the church shows it is under a flood advisory, but not a warning. (Houston police told us that they have no pending calls from the area.)
Several Twitter users have posted pictures questioning the church’s statement, including an image posted by writer Charles Clymer that was apparently taken from near the church showing no flooding near the building. Popular vlogger Keaton Milburn responded:
maybe your anonymous source would like to see these photos. ones of the church actually flooding. know your facts first

The caption on the photos, though, suggest that they were taken near the church, not inside the facility itself. Another Twitter user posted pictures of her own showing no apparent street flooding near the church:

Clymer also posted pictures from a third user which purportedly showed no flooding near either the church’s near entrance or loading docks:

Another local man, Jorge Colmenares, posted a video on Facebook showing a lack of flooding in a garage he identified as belonging to the church. The footage has received more than 70,000 views. He told us:
I was doing recon around my surrondng area and checking up on my work location. Lakewood is always on my route. I was expecting to see flood in the garage area but it wasn’t at all.
However, he added, “Lakewood and it’s surrounding area was legit flooded out” on 26 August 2017, shortly before the calls began for Osteen to make the church available. Colmenares said he had seen pictures online reflecting effects on the church:
The church was flooded on the inside, garage level, basement level, not where the main floors are. It’s a huge place.
We contacted the church seeking additional details about why it was inaccessible — for example, if there was possibly flooding nearby or damage to the building — but we have yet to receive a response. However, Osteen did put up the following tweet:

		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		

The tweet linked to the following statement: 
Dear Lakewood Church family,
We want to let you know that our hearts are with each of you and your families during this difficult time. We are praying for you and we are praying for our city, and for all of those affected by the devastating flooding and rains caused by Hurricane Harvey. We love you and we love this city. And we want to help.
Over the last couple of days, as the enormity of this storm was being realized, we have been working to organize relief efforts for the Houston area with our friend Franklin Graham and the disaster relief organization that he oversees, Samaritan’s Purse. Samaritan’s Purse has been, since it’s inception, organized to respond to situations just like Hurricane Harvey, and we are grateful to be able to partner with them to provide assistance to the Houston area.
We know the need is great. That much is clear. We do not yet know all the ways we can help. However if you would like to register to volunteer with us, please do so by clicking the link below. Or, if you would like to donate to our relief efforts, please do so here in this page. We are working just as fast as we can on this and will update you with more information as it becomes available.
In the meantime, know that our prayers for strength and comfort for each of you will continue, as well as our prayers for God’s help as we navigate the upcoming days and months together.
We love you. And we are praying. Together, we will make it through this difficult time.
Osteen and the church later released a second statement:
We have never closed our doors. We will continue to be a distribution center for those in need. We are prepared to house people once shelters reach capacity. Lakewood will be a value to the community in the aftermath of thris storm in helping our fellow citizens rebuild their lives.
Clymer also posted a picture of what he described as “countless air mattresses” bought by the church, saying that it was “prepping to open its doors”.
On 29 August 2017, the church confirmed on Twitter that it was open to evacuees and taking in supplies.
Lakewood is receiving people who need shelter. We are also coordinating with the city as a collection site for distribution. Lakewood is also collecting diapers, baby formula, baby food and other supplies. Please bring these items to Lakewood at Circle Drive."

						Floridians Can Obtain Food Stamp Benefits If Their Power Went Out During Hurricane Irma?","Florida residents affected by Hurricane Irma can receive $197 in food stamp benefits, but only if they can show that their homes lost power for more than two hours.","Mostly False
					
						
							About this rating","In September 2017, Facebook users spread several rumors about government benefits and assistance available to Florida residents in the aftermath of Hurricane Irma. One of these rumors involved the provision of food stamps for Floridians whose homes had experienced power outages of at least two hours in duration.
A typical expression of the rumor read as follows:
#FLORIDA
If your power was out for more than two hours. You are eligible for food stamps. $197.00 per person. Go to www.myflorida.com/accessflorida … Apply for benefits..create an account. Click on food stamps or snaps..DO NOT APPLY FOR CASH…Make sure you have a valid phone number so they can verify your zip code…
A similar rumor claimed that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), rather than the state of Florida, was overseeing food stamp benefits:
FEMA assistance is available to those whose power was out for more than 2 hours they’re eligible for food stamps 197 per person go to myflorida.com Access Florida apply for benefits create an account click food stamps or snaps do not apply for cash make sure you have valid phone number so they can verify zip code.
	
		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
A separate but related rumor held that FEMA was directly providing Floridians with $500 for food purchases:
For those in need

FEMA is giving $500 direct deposit that can be used for food. Apply at disasterassistance.gov

FEMA 1-800-621-3362 or 1-800-462-7585
None of these rumors was quite right, and they all seemed to be based on misunderstandings of a federal disaster relief program known as Disaster-SNAP (or D-SNAP), which was extended to parts of Florida on 22 September 2017.
D-SNAP is a program that temporarily extends the benefits usually available under SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly known as food stamps) to individuals affected by natural disasters. One does not have to be an existing recipient of SNAP benefits in order to qualify for D-SNAP, but the latter program does incorporate maximum income limits. D-SNAP assistance typically lasts for one month, but Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue announced on 22 September that the program would be in place for two months in Florida.
Recipients are provided with a temporary EBT card containing an amount of credit based upon household size and income.
A one-person household with a gross monthly income of $1,664 or less would receive $194 in D-SNAP credit for one month (a figure that may be the source of the “$197 per person” claim in some Facebook rumors). An eight-person household (provided it has a gross monthly income of $4,151 or less) would be eligible to receive $1,169 in D-SNAP assistance (an average of $146 per person). A two-person household (provided it met the income requirements) would be eligible for $357 in benefits, or $179.50 per person. (There is no set benefit amount per person, a common element of the rumors which is misleading.)
The extension of D-SNAP in Florida applies to certain counties. A county is considered eligible based upon the percentage of power outages experienced over a period of 72 hours, as well as the level of structural and flood damage suffered.
So power outages do play a role in the provision of extended SNAP benefits, but only on the county level. Such benefits come with no requirement that an individual household must have experienced a power outage for “more than two hours,” or that applicants must provide photographic evidence of such outages.		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
The appropriate place to apply for Disaster-SNAP assistance in Florida is the ACCESS Florida web page. 
Other assistance is available
As well as Disaster-SNAP, existing food stamp recipients can avail themselves of certain other enhanced benefits in light of the damage and disruption caused by Hurricane Irma. 
According to the United States Department of Agriculture’s Food and Nutrition Service, which oversees SNAP, regular Florida recipients can (as of 12 September 2017) temporarily use EBT cards to buy hot food (something they cannot normally do) and should have received their monthly allotment earlier than usual in September:
USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) recently approved a temporary waiver and supported other actions that will help households participating in the USDA’s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) in Florida, Georgia, and the Virgin Islands, and the Nutrition Assistance Program in Puerto Rico, to access food in the wake of Hurricane Irma, including:

Allowing SNAP participants in Florida to buy hot foods and hot ready-to-eat foods with their benefits through Sept. 30.
Supporting Florida’s plan to issue all September SNAP benefits on Sept. 7 and Georgia’s plan to issue all remaining benefits for September on Sept. 10; both actions will ensure families have access to their monthly benefits sooner during this time of immediate crisis.


In addition to these modifications, several types of federally-provided assistance are available to those affected by disasters such as Hurricanes Irma and Harvey, both in Florida and in other states. These benefits include monetary assistance with rent and home repairs as well as funeral and medical care costs, as well as direct assistance such as FEMA’s entering into lease agreements with owners of multi-family rental properties and performing repairs, with the aim of providing temporary accommodation for individuals.
Variations in eligibility, rates of payment, duration of assistance, and type of assistance mean that it’s virtually impossible to say how much an individual household or person might receive. Residents of states that have been affected by hurricanes and other disasters can check whether they are eligible for federal assistance, and apply for such assistance, by visiting DisasterAssistance.gov. 
The claim asserted in one of the Facebook rumors, that FEMA is offering individuals $500 via direct deposit to be used for purchasing food, has a grain of truth to it.
As part of the assistance that the federal government provides to individuals and households in state where major disasters have been declared (as was the case in Florida), individuals who have lost their homes or been displaced can apply for what’s known as Critical Needs Assistance, which consists of a one-time payment of $500, as explained by FEMA:
FEMA may provide financial assistance to individuals and households who, as a result of the disaster, have immediate or critical needs because they are displaced from their primary dwelling. Immediate or critical needs are life-saving and life-sustaining items including, but not limited to: water, food, first aid, prescriptions, infant formula, diapers, consumable medical supplies, durable medical equipment, personal hygiene items, and fuel for transportation … It is a one-time $500 payment per household.
However, the state must first ask FEMA to authorize Critical Needs Assistance in specific counties particularly badly hit by a disaster, FEMA must then grant that authorization, and the individual must go through an application process. FEMA has authorized Critical Needs Assistance in certain Florida counties, which are listed on the FEMA web site.
The Critical Needs Assistance application is available only to individuals who have lost their homes or been displaced, and who had previously resided in counties where FEMA has authorized Critical Needs Assistance."

						Major Local News Sites Shuttered Amid ‘Dispiriting’ Rash of Media Closures",null,null,"Journalists and media observers alike are expressing alarm after a rash of closures and restructurings, many of which affected “alternative” outlets or news web sites with an emphasis on local coverage. (Accessible, thorough, and comprehensive local news is widely agreed to be the best inoculant against the proliferation of misinformation and propaganda.)
The most scrutiny was focused on the shuttering of New York City-based DNAInfo as well as the Gothamist family of news sites on 2 November 2017 — just one week after their writers voted to unionize as part of the Writers Guild of America East. A DNAInfo spokesperson said:
The decision by the editorial team to unionize is simply another competitive obstacle making it harder for the business to be financially successful.
A former DNAInfo reporter, Noah Hurowitz, said:
This is a direct retaliation for unionizing. We stood tall, and they fucked us.
	
		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
DNAInfo founder Joe Ricketts — who also founded TD Ameritrade — acquired Gothamist and its affiliated websites in cities like Los Angeles and Chicago among others in March 2017. Shortly thereafter, both Gothamist and Chicagoist deleted stories criticizing him. Ricketts’ family, which owns the Chicago Cubs, also donated $1 million in September 2016 to a super-PAC supporting President Donald Trump’s campaign.
Immediately following the announcement, the sites’ archives were not available, leading to speculation online that their staffs’ work had been deleted. But each of the sites had been restored and available for viewing as of 3 November 2017.
On 23 February 2018, New York public radio station WNYC-FM announced that it acquired both DCist and Gothamist, as well as LAist, through a partnership with two other stations, WAMU-FM in Washington and KPCC-FM, which operates out of Pasadena, California. Laura Walker, president and CEO of WNYC’s parent company New York Public Radio, said:
For more than a decade, Gothamist served as a source of trusted local news. That resonates with us at WNYC, where we are committed to telling stories rooted in New York and that matter to New Yorkers. As we’ve seen a decline in local journalism in even the largest metropolitan areas across the country, even at a time when it’s so vital, we remain committed to strong, independent reporting that fills the void.
A longtime alt-weekly publication in Texas, the Houston Press  announced on 3 November 2017 that it would stop producing a physical printed edition and switch to an online-only format. Editor-in-chief Margaret Downing said in an editorial explaining the move that it was caused by a “mini recession” affecting the gas and oil industry, as well as a drop in advertising revenue and the effects of Hurricane Harvey on local businesses. She said that nearly all of the publication’s employees received termination papers on 3 November 2017:
In the newsroom that means that reporters who were more than competent, who could negotiate the most complicated business documents or talk with sensitivity to people who were going through the worst days of their lives — journalists with passion and discernment whose work has changed lives for the better — are suddenly without a platform, or a paycheck.
We rely upon a sizable number of freelance photographers, graphic artists and videographers whose work is also highly valued. This change will also affect them in the number of assignment opportunities available.
We contacted Downing seeking further comment.
The editor of another weekly alternative publication, San Diego Citybeat’s Seth Combs, told us that weighing decisions like the changes made by the Press is “always a concern.” he said:
When you hear about Houston it’s not completely surprising. But it’s still heartbreaking and dispiriting. I’m not surprised when these things happen. It makes me sad for the people it affects.		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
The benefit of outlets like Gothamist and the Press, he said, is that they are “community-centric.” He added that losing them represents “one less outlet that people can get news and information or satire or op-eds from people who are not only covering their local community but are there beating the bushes in their local community.”
On the national level, publisher Condé Nast announced on 2 November 2017 that it would stop producing the print edition of Teen Vogue magazine. The publication had garnered praise for its pointed coverage of President Donald Trump’s administration. However, the publisher said in a statement:
Though the quarterly print editions will cease publishing on a regular schedule, we will explore reimagined special issues timed to specific moments (vs. months) as we do in social.
Publications geared toward ethnic communities also suffered a loss; on 1 November 2017, the non-profit group New America Media (NAM) announced that both it and its parent company Pacific News Service would cease operating within a month. NAM, which was founded in 1966, created, aggregated, and translated content for ethnic-oriented media outlets around the U.S. Pacific News Service board chair Lawrence Wilkinson said in a statement that his organization is focusing on how its work can continue after the group ceases operations:
As global migration accelerates, too many diaspora populations will need trusted media messengers to stay informed and connected. More immediately, we also believe that the sector’s commitment to work together— to be a bridge across racial and ethnic divides — will be more vital than ever."

It’s not clear what exactly these dates refer to, but they appear to be presented as the dates each hurricane made landfall in the United States. The Big Wobble web site specifically made this claim in a 31 August 2017 article with the headline: “Signs and wonders! Katrina, Gustav, Isaac and Harvey all made landfall on the 29th of August.”
A 29 August 2017 Facebook post by Nola McKinley containing the meme was shared almost 400,000 times within two days. 
The meme does not accurately state the date of first United States landfall for three of the four hurricanes it mentions. Depending on which time zone you use, the fourth date is also inaccurate.
	
		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
There are a number of other issues with the viral spread of this meme, including: a U.S.-centric focus on the damage done by hurricanes in the United States, while ignoring the devastation they often first cause in the Caribbean; and a spurious search for numerical patterns in the midst of tragedy.
The Dates
Here are the key dates leading up to landfall for each of the four hurricanes listed in the meme. All dates refer to events timed according to UTC (Coordinated Universal Time), which is four hours ahead of Eastern time, five ahead of Central time, seven ahead of Pacific time:

28/29 August – Made landfall at Southwest Pass on the mouth of the Mississippi River, Louisiana (12am UTC 29 August, 8pm EST 28 August)
29 August – Moved back over water before making second landfall near Port Fourchon, Louisiana (8am UTC, 4am EST)
		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
Harvey, 2017

17 August – Low pressure disturbance in the Caribbean (3pm UTC, 11am EST)
17 August – Strengthened to a tropical storm, 250 miles east of Barbados (9pm UTC, 5pm EST)
19 August – Weakened to a tropical depression (9pm UTC, 5pm EST)
23/24 August – Strengthened to a tropical storm (4am UTC, 12am EST, 11pm Central 23 August)
24 August – Strengthened to a Category 1 hurricane (5pm UTC, 1pm EST)
25 August – Strengthened to a Category 2 hurricane (5am UTC, 1am EST)
25 August – Strengthened to a Category 3 hurricane (7pm UTC, 3pm EST)
25 August – Strengthened to a Category 4 hurricane (11pm UTC, 7pm EST)
25/26 August – Made landfall on the coast of Texas at San Jose island, just east of Rockport as a Category 4 hurricane (3am UTC 26 August, 11pm EST 25 August)
26 August – Made second landfall at Copano Bay, Texas as a Category 3 hurricane (6am UTC, 2am EST)
30 August – Made third landfall near Cameron, Louisiana as a Tropical Storm (9am UTC, 5am EST)

So if we’re looking at the first United States landfall of these four hurricanes, here’s how the meme should look:
<img loading=""lazy"" class=""aligncenter wp-image-102437"" src=""https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/08/Accurate_hurricane_dates_meme_watermark.jpg"" alt="""" width=""600"" height=""419"" data-recalc-dims=""1"" srcset=""https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/08/Accurate_hurricane_dates_meme_watermark.jpg?resize=715%2C499&amp;zoom=1 715w, https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/08/Accurate_hurricane_dates_meme_watermark.jpg?resize=715%2C499&amp;zoom=0.5 358w, https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/08/Accurate_hurricane_dates_meme_watermark.jpg?resize=715%2C499&amp;zoom=0.25 179w"" sizes=""(max-width: 715px) 100vw, 715px"" />

If we follow Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), only one of these four hurricanes made its first United States landfall on 29 August (Isaac in 2012). 
However, if we follow Eastern time, Isaac’s landfall happened on 28 August, and Harvey’s first landfall happened on 25 August. Either way, none of these four hurricanes shared a United States landfall date with any of the others, undermining the premise of the viral meme.
Hurricanes are not one-off events that take place on a single date. They are phenomena that evolve, develop, strengthen and weaken, moving over and making landfall at various geographic locations over the course of days and weeks. That makes it easy to cherry pick dates to form a “pattern.”
The search for patterns		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
It’s not clear whether those posting and sharing the “8/29” meme are simply pointing out a curious coincidence (even though, as we’ve shown, the dates are wrong), or suggesting that there is some conspiracy (supernatural or man-made) behind them. 
Let’s imagine all these hurricanes did make their first United States landfall on 29 August. What would that mean?
Firstly, it would not necessarily be particularly strange. Late August and early September is peak hurricane season in the Atlantic. While all four highlighted hurricanes did not make their first U.S. landfall on the same date, they did each occur within the same eight-day period, between 25 August and 1 September. 
Secondly, it would not be an example of government geoengineering or climate engineering. Conspiracy theorists have already claimed that Hurricane Harvey is “the latest example of covert weather warfare being waged on completely unsuspecting populations…orchestrated and manipulated by an ever more desperate and aggressive global power structure.”
And some have claimed that the “8/29” date pattern in the meme is a clear sign of sinister government orchestration. Setting aside the fact that the dates are wrong, it is unclear why the U.S. government would choose to schedule the United States landfall of four hurricanes for the same calendar date across 12 years, or how this would even be possible. If the supposed purpose of climate engineering is to wage “weather warfare” against “unsuspecting populations,” why would the purported conspirators continuously choose the same date? 
Conclusion
There is a pattern behind the dates of these four hurricanes – they all made their first United States landfall within an eight-day period, in different years. But this has a very simple and boring explanation: 25 August-1 September is part of peak hurricane season in the Atlantic. 
Any interpretation of hurricane dates that goes beyond this is entirely spurious, requiring as it does ludicrous government conspiracy theories or supernatural predetermination. However, the desire to find numerical patterns and explanations in the midst of terrible human tragedy, such as that brought by Hurricane Harvey, is a very understandable one. 
We saw similar spurious memes about the dates of terrorist attacks in the aftermath of the 22nd May 2017 suicide bombing at an arena in Manchester, England. Faced with the horror of dozens of children being slaughtered at a pop concert, many found comfort or distraction in pointing out a supposed pattern of terrorist attacks on the 22nd day of various months. In reality, a terrorist attack is no more likely to happen on the 22nd than any other day of the month."

						Residents Cough, Rub Eyes in Harvey Pollution Spike",null,"This article is republished here with permission from The Associated Press. This content is shared here because the topic may interest Snopes readers; it does not, however, represent the work of Snopes fact-checkers or editors.","GALENA PARK, Texas (AP) — Cindy Sanchez began to feel ill while barbecuing just before Harvey’s torrents started pelting this city just east of Houston, along a corridor with the nation’s highest concentration of petrochemical plants.
“I started getting really, really bad headaches,” said Sanchez, a 32-year-old housewife. “I never get headaches.”
“My husband’s eyes were burning,” she said. “He actually had a napkin that was wet over his eyes.” The sewage-like stench chased the couple indoors and Sanchez, sick to her stomach, lay down.
Petrochemical corridor residents say air that is bad enough on normal days got worse as Harvey crashed into the nation’s fourth-largest city and then yielded the highest ozone pollution so far this year anywhere in Texas. The Houston metro area was ranked 12th in the nation for worst ozone pollution by The American Lung Association this year, although its air was better than the Los Angeles and New York regions.
Plants owned by Shell, Chevron, Exxon-Mobil and other industry giants reported more than 1.5 million pounds (680 metric tons) of extraordinary emissions over eight days beginning Aug. 23 to the Texas Commission of Environmental Quality in Harris County, which encompasses Houston. That amounted to 61 percent of this year’s largely unpermitted emissions for the county and five times the amount released in the same period in 2016. Of the known carcinogens released during Harvey, more than 13 tons were benzene. Inhaling it can cause dizziness and even unconsciousness and long-term exposure can trigger leukemia.
	
		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
People complained of headaches, nausea, itchy skin and throats — classic symptoms of industrial chemical exposure — as plants and refineries raced to burn off compounds that could combust in extreme weather or power loss.
Asked about the health effects of the dramatic emissions spike, state environmental commission spokeswoman Andrea Morrow said “all measured concentrations were well below levels of health concern” and “local residents should not be concerned about air quality issues related to the effects of the storm.” The federal Environmental Protection Agency issued a similar statement.
Yet most air monitors were knocked out or offline during Harvey’s wrath, making measurement difficult.
Texas sets fines low for industrial polluters— at $25,000 per day for federal clean air violations. Big plants tend to delay shutdowns for as long as possible when a hurricane is coming — then restart quickly afterward — triggering another spike in unhealthy emissions, said Daniel Cohan, a Rice University environmental scientist.
“These (plants) are three and four decades old, beasts that are meant to operate all the time.”
Asked if emissions could have been reduced by winding down plant operations sooner, American Petroleum Institute spokesman Reid Porter said: “We are still gathering information and making assessments.”
Some emissions were triggered by the sheer volume of Harvey’s deluge.
At an Arkema Inc. plant about 25 miles (40 kilometers) northeast of downtown Houston, organic peroxides rendered unstable by lost refrigeration exploded in flames and cast an acrid plume. At least 18 tons burned after people within a 1.5-mile (2.4-kilometer) radius were evacuated.		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
Benzene and other toxins spilled into the air outside the Valero Partners refinery on Houston’s east side, as heavy rains damaged a tank’s floating roof and invaded a dike.
A city health department air monitor downwind of the refinery on Friday registered an alarming level of up to 14,000 parts per billion of volatile organic compounds, some carcinogenic, said department chief scientist Loren Raun, and aerial monitoring continued to detect benzene on Monday.
On Friday, Houston registered Texas’ worst ozone pollution this year — an average of 95 parts per billion (ppb) over eight hours. It was Harris County’s first of four straight days of unhealthy ozone levels, exceeding the EPA standard of 70 ppb.
By volume, most of Harris County’s emissions were sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds, which break down to fine particles and ozone that all can cause respiratory problems, especially for people with asthma and emphysema, said Miriam Rotkin-Ellman, a health scientist for environmental group Natural Resources Defense Council.
Of the dozen plants in Harris County reporting storm-related emissions, Exxon Mobil, Chevron Phillips and Shell Oil have been fined or ordered to pay settlements totaling $27.8 million since 2010 for violating federal environmental laws after suits by The Sierra Club and Environment Texas. A federal judge ordered Exxon Mobil in May to pay most of it — $19.9 million — for illegal emissions from its Baytown refinery. Exxon Mobil is appealing. The other two companies paid, said Philip Hilder, attorney for the environmental groups.
In heavily Latino lower middle-income communities like Pasadena and Galena Park, which sit along the plant and refinery corridor near Houston’s seaport, some residents complained of feeling sick during Harvey.
Ruben Basurto, who lives two blocks from a petrochemical shipping terminal and refinery, described major flaring as Harvey hit — the burning off of volatile byproducts of petrochemical manufacture that sends flames soaring from plant stacks. The air reeked of natural gas, he said, driving him and his friends inside.
“It still smelled at midweek, more during the night,” said the 33-year-old construction worker.		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
As the storm closed in, Gov. Greg Abbott decreed the temporary suspension of emissions regulations. The state environmental agency’s director said Texas law could exempt refineries and chemical plants from state fines and liability for extraordinary releases resulting from “an act of God, war, strike, riot, or other catastrophe. ”
In Galena Park, mothers in a private Facebook group described sickening odors like “sweet gasoline,” raw sewage and thick air.
Some in the city of 11,000 with a median household income of $43,000 called 911 but police were too busy to respond, said local environmental activist Juan Flores.
“A lot of people are afraid to talk because their husbands work in the plants,” said Flores.
People in the petrochemical corridor should be provided health screening as a next step in Harvey recovery, said Rotkin-Ellman of the environmental group NRDC.
A Harris County pollution control services toxicologist, Latrice Babin, said she was not aware of any special screening.
Sanchez’s headaches still hadn’t gone away on Wednesday. Nor had the sickening smell, she said.
She wants to see a doctor, but like many in her neighborhood, she said, Sanchez currently has no health insurance.

							About this rating","On 31 August 2017, repeat offender TheLastLineOfDefense.com published a “report” on the “Ramashan Mosque” in Houston, which according to them, refused to help people seeking relief from the flooding caused by Hurricane Harvey:
The building can easily hold over 500 people, much more than the 27 currently inside. But the imam of the mosque, Aswat Turads, says that they absolutely cannot accept any non-Muslim people because it’s against their religion.
“The Quran is very clear,” Turads told local news radio station WXTX, “we are forbidden from helping infidels, no matter how much we want to. If we allow Christians and Jews inside, we are violating a fundamental tenant of Islam and will be punished by Allah.
The original version of the story (and an equally fake follow-up post) also included a picture of Canadian imam Ibrahim Hindy, who publicly refuted the story, saying that not only was he in Saudi Arabia completing the hajj Islamic pilgrimage at the time the massive storm hit Texas, he has never been to that state in his life at all:


The site quickly swapped out its photographs in response. The current version of the story now includes an Associated Press picture of a Lebanese cleric, Ahmad al-Assir, who was arrested by authorities in his country in August 2015.
This story is a complete fabrication, and neither the “Ramashan Mosque” or “Aswat Turads” exist. The radio station named in the article, WXTX-FM, is actually based out of Columbus, Georgia and not Texas. TheLastLineOfDefense.com is a known purveyor of fake news stories. Its disclaimer reads:
America’s Last Line of Defense is a satirical publication that may sometimes appear to be telling the truth. We assure you that’s not the case. We present fiction as fact and our sources don’t actually exist.

In other words, if you believe this crap you’re a real dumbass.
Despite its complete lack of any factual content, the hoax story was shared thousands of times; it was also picked up and run verbatim as true by other web sites. In reality, several Houston mosques have taken people in and performed volunteer food and donation drives to help victims of the storm."

Why You Shouldn’t Swim After a Hurricane
This picture was taken in Puerto Rico shortly after Hurricane Irene ravaged the island. Yes, that’s a shark swimming down the street next to a car, and this is exactly why authorities in NYC are warning people not to go swimming in flood waters after a hurricane. Sharks go where fish go, and fish go where water goes, and if that water (and those subsequent fish) happen to be right outside your front door, then guess where that freakin’ shark’s going to be?!

Then and now, the photograph is a digital hoax. The image of the shark was lifted from a 2005 photograph of a kayaker being trailed by a great white shark and pasted into a photograph of a flooded street:

							About this rating","The Red Cross has long been dogged by the persistent belief that it exacts payment for its services from the victims of disasters. In the wake of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 that notion surfaced again, this time asserting those left homeless and desperate were being charged for coffee, cups of juice, and cookies:
We heard that the red cross was charging people in New Orleans 70 for a cup of juice and a cookie? Assuming we donate money to pay for the aid, could this be true?

I’ve recently heard the Red Cross & maybe the Salvation Army sends bills to the people they help. Say it isn’t so!!

I do know one person, a close friend of mine, who about 20 years ago was displaced due to an apartment building fire. She was provided shelter by the Red Cross but later received a bill from them for their services. That’s the only place I’ve heard the story and it wasn’t a rumor.


The rumor is false: rhe Red Cross does not solicit payment for services rendered from those whom it is called upon to assist during times of emergency. The American Red Cross notes on their web page about disaster preparedness for seniors that “All American Red Cross emergency services are provided free of charge,” and the Southeast Michigan Red Cross web site’s ‘Ask Us‘ page plainly states:

Q: How much does American Red Cross disaster assistance cost?
A: All American Red Cross disaster assistance is free, made possible by the voluntary donations of time and money from the American people. Disaster assistance is given free-of-charge without judgment or a promise of support.
Modern rumors about the service’s turning a profit by taking items it had been supplied with via donations and selling them to the needy date to World War I. George Creel, Chairman of the Committee on Public Information at that time, offered the opinion that vilification tales aimed at the Red Cross bore unmistakable signs of enemy origin, begun in the hopes the negative stories would turn people against the organization. In WWI, and again in WWII, the slander took the form of cautionary tales about sweaters knit by volunteers as gifts for men serving at the front being instead sold to those troops by the Red Cross. One altruistic knitter, it was said, received a letter from a sailor who had come to be in possession of her work, in which the Navy man both thanked her for the garment and asked if she thought it fair he’d had to pay six dollars for it. Also rampant in WWII was scuttlebutt that soldiers serving in the Pacific theater were forced to pay five dollars for cardigans that had Red Cross labels in them. The sweaters the Red Cross collected from volunteers and sent to servicemen were, of course, never sold to GIs; they were always provided for free.
	
		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
Similarly, the Red Cross was said to be selling to servicemen cigarettes that had been donated by major tobacco companies.
The Red Cross blood donor service was also a target of rumor-mongering during WWII. Whispers swept along that blood donations had been accepted from the Japanese, thereby (it was said) making it likely the offspring of those receiving such transfusions would display Japanese characteristics. Similar concerns were raised about blood from African-Americans being added to the pool. Rumor was also used to discourage those inclined to donate blood: stories were spread that those who gave ran the risk of contracting infection or disease from unsterilized instruments.
The Affairs of Dame Rumor, a 1948 book about rumors rampant in America, recorded the following:
The Red Cross rumors illustrate that the enemy rumor mill was designed to sabotage anything the American people might do to help their own war effort. If they were asked to lend aid by contributing their money to this organization, there was a lie that the Red Cross money was terribly mishandled and their books unaudited. If they were asked to become volunteer workers, there was a canard about men in the army saying there is no need for it. If they were being enlisted as consistent blood donors, there was a prohibitive fable about how blood plasma could be kept for only two months and if not used by then was thrown away. If American ladies persisted in knitting sweaters, the falsehood to discourage them was that garments sent to England were being ripped up and the wool sold to the British people. And lies of inefficient practices and waste dogged the efforts of the Red Cross throughout the war.
There is truth to one of the rumors, however. During WWII the American Red Cross did indeed charge American servicemen stationed abroad for coffee, doughnuts, and lodging. However, they did so because the U.S. Army asked them to, not because they were determined to make a profit off homesick dogfaces.
The request was made in a March 1942 letter from Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson to Norman H. Davis, chairman of the American Red Cross. Because American soldiers were fighting as part of the Allied Forces, matters had to be considered on a Force-wide (rather than a solely American) basis. The Red Cross was asked to establish club facilities for U.S. servicemen overseas where Allied troops would be welcome, and because English and Australian soldiers were being charged for the use of such facilities, it was deemed unfair that Americans were to get similar benefits for free (especially in light of the fact that their pay was higher than that of their Allied counterparts). For the good of the alliance, the American Red Cross was persuaded to exact nominal charges from American GIs for off-base food and lodging.
This act resulted in the Red Cross’ coming to be regarded by numerous GIs as having profited off them. Bad feeling exists to this day over the decision to charge American servicemen for these services, with any number of such soldiers and their families carrying long-lasting resentments against the service. Yet while that ire might have been merited, it was misdirected: the culprit was the U.S. Army, not the Red Cross.
General Dwight D. Eisenhower, Chief of Staff, United States Army, addressed the controversy surrounding this issue in a statement to the press on 10 April 1946:
I am surprised to learn that one of the reasons [for Americans not contributing to the American Red Cross] is the complaints being leveled at the organization’s overseas operations by returning servicemen. For the most part these criticisms have grown out of a Red Cross policy of making nominal charges to our forces for food and lodgings in fixed Red Cross installations abroad. These complaints are distressing to me since this particular Red Cross policy was adopted at the request of the Army, so as to insure an equitable distribution among all service personnel of Red Cross resources.I know the Red Cross. I have seen it in action. Overseas it performed with the precision of a well-trained army. It would be grave injustice to the splendid work of the Red Cross if its campaign should be retarded anywhere by mistaken criticisms.		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
Even after World War II, the Red Cross continued to be dogged for years by false tales about their imposing fees on military personnel for basic humanitarian services, such as the following 1952 rumor that claimed the organization had charged a U.S. serviceman interest on money he borrowed from them to attend his mother’s funeral:
A recent rumor to the effect that a serviceman had been loaned money by the Red Cross at 6 per cent interest so he could attend his mother’s funeral was revealed by the local chapter.When the rumor proved to be unfounded, said a local Red Cross official, the serviceman wrote to deny the story: “I have not been asked to pay 6 per cent interest on this loan nor has it ever been suggested by anyone employed by the American Red Cross that I pay interest,” he said. “It was through the joint effort of the Hartford Chapter and the office of the field director that I was granted a leave …”
The story of the interest charging went through a nearby summer resort “like wildfire,” reported the official.
The Red Cross’ version was this: the local serviceman had just been inducted and was beginning his service at an Air Force base. The Red Cross notified him of his mother’s death, and since the serviceman was without enough money for the trip, the chapter advanced him more than $100 which he agreed to pay over a prolonged period — without interest.
The advent of social media breathed new life into rumors the Red Cross was charging disaster victims, which spiked amid separate online controversies involving the organization following Hurricanes Harvey and Irma in August-September 2017:

There is a post going viral stating Red Cross stole goods from churches in Texas in the wake of Harvey and that they are charging 1.25 for water that was donated. 

The Red Cross was stealing from the doorsteps of churches after Harvey devastated Texas. They were protected by order EO 13603, which is an executive order that was signed on March 16 of 2012 by Barack Obama. You can find this information at ObamaWhiteHouse.archives.gov

I am working at a kitchen in midtown Houston that is providing food support to affected areas. We have received several reports that Red Cross sites in the Port Arthur/Beaumont area are, in fact, charging for food. These are reports directly from the field by phone, not internet. We are trying to track down more supporting info for this claim, but it was reported by at least 3 people on site.

In a separate article regarding rumors that the Red Cross was charging  disaster victims after Hurricane Harvey hit in August 2017, we noted:
Just to make sure their policy regarding disaster assistance has not changed since the last time these claims surfaced, we reached out to the Red Cross to ask if they charged for any disaster relief related services in the wake of Harvey. A media representative assured us that all Red Cross disaster assistance is provided free of charge.
The rumors, this time, seem to have spread most rapidly from a 28 August 2017 piece (“Why You Shouldn’t Donate to the Red Cross to Help Hurricane Victims”) by Affinity Magazine, which makes the statement that some disaster victims never received money collected by the organization that was ostensibly there to help them:
When the World Trade Center went down back in 2001, the Red Cross this time raised over a billion dollars in donations. Again, victims of the terrorist attack never saw the money. They opened only a few shelters during the attack and no one came to them. They even handed out coffee and donuts for the rescue workers on site, yet charged them for the food and drinks.

On 31 August 2017, the Red Cross detailed how they would be spending their funds in the wake of Hurricane Harvey, introducing that documentation with the following statement:

The American Red Cross has been truly humbled by the outpouring of public support for those affected by Hurricane Harvey. Working around the clock, the Red Cross is making good use of donations and bringing help where it is needed. Each cot holding a sleeping child, each meal served to a family who is hungry and each blanket a disaster worker wraps around someone wet from the floodwaters is a result of a generous donation. As the storm moves north, flash flood emergencies are in effect throughout the Gulf Coast, and the storm may produce as much as a foot of rain through the end of the week."

							About this rating","On 29 August 2017, readers sent in e-mails asking whether it was true Joel Osteen sailed through a flooded Houston distributing copies of his book Your Best Life Now:
Did this really happen, cause if so thats horrible…

There is a pic on FB that shows Osteens boat around Houston passing his prosperity book out. Any truth to this?

Is it true that Joel Osteen sailed his yacht through the streets passing out his book?
Osteen’s name had already worked through social media during and after Hurricane Harvey because of stories that Lakewood Church was not made available to people affected by the historic storm. The “yacht” claim originated with the Babylon Bee:
Although Joel Osteen took flak over the weekend for closing up his church to flood victims and all but disappearing during the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey, the megachurch pastor reportedly returned to the city on his luxury yacht “S.S. Blessed” to make amends Tuesday by tossing copies of Your Best Life Now to stranded flood survivors.
Osteen had his on-call yacht captain steer the large vessel through the flooded streets of the city, pulling up to survivors stranded on their roofs and on the roof of their cars as the prosperity gospel preacher smiled, waved, and threw out signed editions of the bestselling positive thinking book … Osteen also paused for brief photo ops with several families, the smiling pastor briefly allowing them to board his yacht as his professional photography team got shots of the pastor together with the sobbing, distraught flood victims, though the pastor was careful to not stand too close to the mud-caked refugees. Sources confirmed that the pastor then had his assistants help the families back into their makeshift lifeboats or tree logs on which they were floating through the city.
Osteen and the Christian culture of which he is a part is a frequent target of Babylon Bee, but a disclaimer at the bottom of the page reads:
The Babylon Bee is Your Trusted Source For Christian News Satire.
As is so often the case, the claim about Osteen’s yacht voyage through a devastated Houston was copied to other sites, where it was not clearly marked as satire."

On 1 September 2017, the post in question had more than 140,000 shares (seven times the 20,000 shares needed to hit $100,000, more than effectively ending the donation drive):



Walmart purportedly donated a million dollars for Harvey relief:


Did Walmart donate 1,000,000 for Harvey rescue efforts?
Mostly true. On 30 August 2017 Walmart issued a press release pledging that “Walmart will donate up to $10 million in cash and product to match customer donations two to one”:
HOUSTON, Aug. 30, 2017 – Walmart and the Walmart Foundation have committed up to $20 million in support of relief efforts in response to the severe weather impacting the Gulf region. This includes $10 million focused on support of American Red Cross shelters and $2 million in support of the Hurricane Harvey Relief Fund at the Greater Houston Community Foundation, which was announced today at a press briefing with Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner.
To help those in need, Walmart is launching a customer campaign with the American Red Cross to assist with Hurricane Harvey relief. As part of the customer campaign, Walmart is matching customer donations two to one with cash and product donations of up to $10 million to support American Red Cross disaster relief. Walmart’s initial focus will be on mega-shelters, providing items to meet basic needs, such as water, infant formula, diapers, underwear and personal hygiene products. We will also aim to increase comfort in these shelters by providing items such as TVs, DVDs, games and stuffed animals for children and healthy snacks, such as fresh fruit.
Walmart and the Walmart Foundation will also give additional cash and product donations totaling $10 million to support the Salvation Army, Feeding America, Convoy of Hope, Team Rubicon and the Hurricane Harvey Relief Fund at the Greater Houston Community Foundation, as well as other organizations assisting food distribution, sheltering and cleanup efforts.


The NFL donated at least a million dollars to Harvey victims:

Mostly true. On 28 August 2017, the National Football League (NFL) issued a press release confirming that it would match Houston Texans’ owner Bob McNair‘s million dollar donation to Harvey relief efforts:
The NFL Foundation will match Mr. McNair and the Houston Texans’ $1 million contribution to the United Way Relief Fund to address the immediate needs of those impacted by Hurricane Harvey. The total $2 million contribution will support first response efforts by the American Red Cross, Salvation Army and the United Way of Greater Houston. Our thoughts are with the Houston community during this difficult time and we encourage fans to text HARVEY to 90999 to donate $10 to American Red Cross Hurricane Harvey relief.​
Moreover, NFL.com subsequently reported several additional NFL-related efforts to raise or send money for disaster relief. In total $6.2 million was donated by NFL teams and the league, and millions more were pledged in the form of promised donations or donation-matching:
Here’s a rundown of other teams who are donating to Hurricane Harvey relief efforts:
1. The Houston Texans and owner Bob McNair are donating $1 million in Hurricane Harvey relief.

This content is shared here because the topic may interest Snopes readers; it does not, however, represent the work of Snopes fact-checkers or editors.","The names of hurricanes may change, but one thing seems to stay the same: Misinformation spreads quickly during these dangerous storms.
Hurricane Dorian, an extremely powerful Category 4 storm that has brought misery to the Bahamas since making landfall Sunday, is expected to be no different.
Here’s a sampling of false information, fabricated photos and hoaxes that have accompanied other big name hurricanes. While some of the misleading information — much of which is spread on social media — may be lighthearted, it can also create confusion or lead to dangerous situations.

	
		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
CLAIM: All shelters and hotels are required to take in pets.
THE FACTS: It depends on the shelter. Before heading to a shelter or hotel, check to make sure that they allow pets. However, the Americans with Disabilities Act does require that hotels and shelters take in service animals, according to FEMA.
CLAIM: Keeping a window slightly open will prevent wind pressure from breaking them.
THE FACTS: This is false. All doors and windows should be kept closed so debris doesn’t come in, according to NOAA. Windows should be boarded up with plywood, not taped.
CLAIM: Generators can be used indoors.
THE FACTS: A portable generator should never be turned on indoors, even if doors and windows are open. Generators release carbon monoxide, which can be deadly. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says to keep a generator at least 20 feet away from the house. Don’t refill the generator with gasoline while it’s still turned on.
CLAIM: Immigration and Customs Enforcement along with U.S. Customs and Border Patrol officials check for citizenship status at shelters.
THE FACTS: FEMA rebutted this claim during Hurricane Harvey in 2017. During Harvey, ICE and CBP released a statement stating that routine noncriminal immigration enforcement operations would not be conducted at evacuation sites or at shelters or food banks.		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
An ICE spokesman told The Associated Press in an email that the statement holds true for Dorian.
“Despite false rumors to the contrary, ICE does not conduct immigration enforcement operations at hurricane evacuation sites or shelters, such as during and immediately after hurricanes,” he said.
CLAIM: Don’t remove wet carpeting and flooring until FEMA assesses it.
THE FACTS: Cleaning up after the storm won’t stop you from receiving FEMA assistance. Take photos and video of damaged property for FEMA, and clean up as soon as possible to prevent mold.
Probably the most popular image to circulate on social media when there is a storm or flooding is a manipulated image of a shark swimming in a flooded roadway by a car. And by Thursday, such an image was being floated on Facebook."

							About this rating","On 29 August 2017, houstonchronicle-tv.com (not Houston Chronicle) published an item appearing to report that boxing champion Floyd Mayweather donated $200 million to Hurricane Harvey relief efforts three days after a widely-publicized bout:
There’s a well known saying that “To whom much is given, much is expected” and by all accounts, it appears Floyd Mayweather Jr. knows what he means on the world stage. He’s living up to that expectation. By way of financial support, the newly retired American boxer, Mayweather has offered an overwhelming sum of money to the Hurricane Harvey victims.
The World No. 1 undefeated boxer Floyd Mayweather has donated 200 million dollars to help rebuild Houston, after the most populous city in the state of Texas and the fourth-most populous city in the United States was slammed by Hurricane Harvey on Sunday.
The donation which will be utilized through his foundation was announced today after he travelled to Houston to ascertain the damage caused by the hurricane.
“It is a humanitarian gesture, an act of solidarity and support for a brotherly affected people,” the American boxing hero said.
The item was in part identifiable as fake news by its misleading URL; the actual Chronicle‘s web site is located at Chron.com. Although the story about Floyd Mayweather’s Hurricane Harvey donation had no disclaimer, houstonchronicle-tv.com previously published fake news.
The actual Houston Chronicle carried no such story.
Variations: On 30 August 2017, readers began asking if Manny Pacquiao had donated a sizeable sum of money to Harvey relief efforts:
I just came across a post on Facebook saying Manny Pacquiao donated $50 million to the hurricane Harvey victims. After reading the article on Scopes about Mayweather, I suppose this one on Pacquiao is also fake news.

Manny Pacquiao donates $50 million to Hurricane Harvey victims.

The claim was published by the web site usa360-tv.com, and featured a logo nearly identical to that of the New York Daily News (again, posing as a well-known paper). In addition to structural similarities between the two fake news sites, another veracity-related clue was near-identical verbiage employed by both pages:
There’s a well known saying that “To whom much is given, much is expected” and by all accounts, it appears Manny Pacquiao knows what he means on the world stage. He’s living up to that expectation. By way of financial support, the Filipino professional boxer and politician, Manny Pacquiao has offered an overwhelming sum of money to the Hurricane Harvey victims.

This content is shared here because the topic may interest Snopes readers; it does not, however, represent the work of Snopes fact-checkers or editors.","WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump on Monday rejected a central conclusion of a dire report on the economic costs of climate change released by his own administration.
But economists said the National Climate Assessment’s warning of hundreds of billions of dollars a year in global warming costs is pretty much on the money.
Just look at last year with Hurricanes Harvey, Maria and Irma, they said. Those three 2017 storms caused at least $265 billion in damage , according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
The climate report, quietly unveiled Friday, warned that natural disasters are worsening in the United States because of global warming.
It said warming-charged extremes “have already become more frequent, intense, widespread or of long duration.” The report noted the last few years have smashed U.S. records for damaging weather, costing nearly $400 billion since 2015.
	
		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
“The potential for losses in some sectors could reach hundreds of billions of dollars per year by the end of this century,” the report said. It added that if emissions of heat-trapping gases continue at current levels, labor costs in outdoor industries during heat waves could cost $155 billion in lost wages per year by 2090.
The president said he read some of the report “and it’s fine” but not the part about the devastating economic impact.
“I don’t believe it,” Trump said, adding that if “every other place on Earth is dirty, that’s not so good.”
Nearly every country in the world in 2015 pledged to reduce or slow the growth of carbon dioxide emissions, the chief greenhouse gas.
“We’re already there,” said Wesleyan University economist Gary Yohe, who was a reviewer of the national report, which was produced by 13 federal agencies and outside scientists. “Climate change is making a noticeable impact on our economy right now: Harvey, Florence, Michael, Maria.”
Yohe said, “It is devastating at particular locations, but for the entire country? No.”
Economist Ray Kopp, a vice president at the think tank Resources For the Future and who wasn’t part of the assessment, said the economics and the science in the report were absolutely credible.
“I believe this is going to be a devastating loss without any other action-taking place,” Kopp said Monday. “This is certainly something you would want to avoid.”		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
Earlier, the White House had played down the report. Spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said in an emailed statement that the report “is largely based on the most extreme scenario, which contradicts long-established trends by assuming that, despite strong economic growth that would increase greenhouse gas emissions, there would be limited technology and innovation, and a rapidly expanding population. ”
Throughout the 29-chapter report, scientists provide three scenarios that the United Nations’ climate assessments use. One is the business-as-usual scenario, which scientists say is closest to the current situation. That is the worst case of the three scenarios. Another would envision modest reductions in heat-trapping gases, and the third would involve severe cuts in carbon dioxide pollution.
For example, the $155 billion a year in extra labor costs at the end of the century is under the business-as-usual scenario. Modest reductions in carbon pollution would cut that to $75 billion a year, the report said.
The report talks of hundreds of billions of dollars in economic losses in several spots. In one graphic, it shows the worst-case business-as-usual scenario of economic costs reaching 10 percent of gross domestic product when Earth is about a dozen degrees warmer than now with no specific date.
Yohe said it was unfortunate that some media jumped on that 10 percent number because that was a rare case of hyperbole in the report.
“The 10 percent is not implausible as a possible future for 2100,” Yohe said. “It’s just not terribly likely.”
Kopp, on the other hand, said the 10 percent figure seems believable.
“This is probably a best estimate,” Kopp said. “It could be larger. It could be smaller.”"

							About this rating","In early September 2016, the confluence of Hurricane Hermine and a viral comment made by a televised Donald Trump supporter (about how taco trucks would be appearing on every corner in the U.S. should Trump lose the presidential election) revived interest in Mexico’s September 2005 response to Hurricane Katrina:
<img loading=""lazy"" class=""black-border aligncenter wp-image-49363 size-full"" src=""https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2016/09/mexican-response-to-hurricane-katrina.jpg"" alt=""mexican response to hurricane katrina"" width=""496"" height=""510"" data-recalc-dims=""1"" srcset=""https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2016/09/mexican-response-to-hurricane-katrina.jpg?resize=496%2C510&amp;zoom=1 496w, https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2016/09/mexican-response-to-hurricane-katrina.jpg?resize=496%2C510&amp;zoom=0.5 248w, https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2016/09/mexican-response-to-hurricane-katrina.jpg?resize=496%2C510&amp;zoom=0.25 124w"" sizes=""(max-width: 496px) 100vw, 496px"" />
 

On 30 August 2016, the Facebook page for Mic. published a video reporting that Mexico’s purported response to Hurricane Katrina was “an encouraging moment which counteracts” the notion the country is “constantly in need,” adding that when Mexico sends its people across our border “history shows they’ve sent their best and bravest”:

Hurricane Katrina marked the costliest natural disaster in American history and the third most deadly, claiming at least 1,800 lives after the failure of levees caused catastrophic flooding in some of New Orleans’ most populous areas. Katrina was both newsworthy and culturally significant, inspiring multiple television documentaries and programs as well as rumors that continue to circulate years after the fact. 
	
		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
The latter circumstance was likely due to the chaos that ensued after Katrina, as myriad accounts surfaced well after the floodwaters receded and the news media had moved on to other stories. Mic.‘s assertion that Mexico sent troops across the American border to assist what was by most accounts a stilted federal response to the tragedy was news to many social media users when it cropped up again in August 2016.
Mexico’s response to Hurricane Katrina was well-documented at the time, but rarely included in retrospectives and long-form accounts of the storm and its aftermath, leading many social media users to question whether the claim was truly accurate. In July 2015, the Associated Press published archival footage of Mexican soldiers providing aid in Biloxi:


In August 2015, former diplomat Stephen R. Kelly penned an opinion piece for the Washington Post about Mexican troops and Katrina (again, through the lens of Trump’s statements):
In a scene that would have given Donald Trump heart palpitations, 200 flag-waving Mexican troops breached the U.S. border outside Laredo, Tex., 10 years ago and advanced unopposed up Interstate 35 to San Antonio.
It was the first time a Mexican army had marched on San Antonio since 1836 when Gen. Santa Ana massacred besieged Texas independence fighters at the Alamo.
This time, however, the Mexican soldiers were on a relief mission to feed tens of thousands of homeless and hungry Americans displaced by Hurricane Katrina. Setting up camp at a former Air Force base outside San Antonio, they distributed potable water, medical supplies and 7,000 hot meals a day for the next three weeks.
If this doesn’t sound like the Mexico you’ve been hearing about lately — the one that has been ripping America off, the one that sends rapists and criminals across the border — you might want to consider this little-known gesture of humanity from our abused southern neighbor as you think about Katrina 10 years later.
I was serving as the No. 2 at the U.S. Embassy in Mexico City in August 2005 when Katrina made landfall on the Gulf Coast. The storm’s track posed no danger to Mexico, and we followed events like most expatriate Americans — aghast, but at a distance.
But not Mexicans. They were watching the same scenes of floating corpses and botched relief efforts in New Orleans. My chief contact at Mexico’s Foreign Ministry called to say the Mexican army had two field kitchens that could feed storm victims who had made their way to Texas, he said, and the navy had two ships that could help with cleanup efforts in New Orleans.
To put this in context, the United States likes to think of itself as the country that does the helping, as we had done when Mexico City was struck by a devastating earthquake in 1985. But few had contemplated the possibility that Mexico would be coming to help us … The 45-vehicle convoy crossed the border at Laredo at dawn on Sept. 8 and arrived in San Antonio later that day. The only glitch was that the USDA would not allow the Mexicans to serve the beef they had brought because they couldn’t prove it had been produced in a mad-cow-free facility. Undeterred — and un-insulted — the Mexicans bought their beef locally.
By the time their mission in San Antonio ended Sept. 25, the Mexicans had served 170,000 meals, helped distribute more than 184,000 tons of supplies and conducted more than 500 medical consultations.
Disasters such as Hurricane Katrina, or the spectacle of U.S. presidential politics, often force to the surface the true character of the players. The Mexicans proved they were neighbors we can count on.		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
A few traces of the years-old news story remained online as of 2017:
A Mexican army convoy rolled into the United States with food, water and medicine for Hurricane Katrina victims, the first Mexican military operation on U.S. soil in 90 years.
Part of an aid package that includes ships and rescue teams, the convoy of 45 olive-green vehicles and some 200 troops went over the Rio Grande into Texas from the city of Nuevo Laredo, witnesses said …
The Mexican army trucks, filled with of thousands of ready-to-eat meals, drinking water and medical equipment, were searched like regular vehicles as they crossed the border early on Thursday headed for San Antonio, Texas customs officials said.
Although Mexico’s response to Katrina was often overlooked in historical accounts of the disaster, the accounts are completely true. Mexican troops crossed the border in a 45-vehicle convoy on 8 September 2005, providing material and physical aid to several areas of the Gulf Coast devastated by Katrina; the Mexican army offered hundreds of thousands of meals and tons of supplies to those in need and performed hundreds of medical consultations during a time when the United States was struggling to provide aid to its own citizens in devastated areas.
Hurricane Harvey made landfall in Texas on 25 August 2017. As relief efforts were underway two days later, President Donald Trump tweeted:

With Mexico being one of the highest crime Nations in the world, we must have THE WALL. Mexico will pay for it through reimbursement/other.
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 27, 2017

Twitter users responded to President Trump’s tweet, reiterating the claim about Mexican troops and Hurricane Katrina:

Mexico’s government also responded to Trump’s tweet, releasing a statement that read in part:
The Mexican government takes this opportunity to express its full solidarity with the people and government of the United States as a result of the damages caused by Hurricane Harvey in Texas, and expresses that it has offered to provide help and cooperation to the US government in order to deal with the impact of this natural disaster — as good neighbors should always do in trying times."

						Is Hurricane Irma on Track to Become a ‘Category 6’ Storm?","Hurricane Irma is projected to be so big that it may become a ""Category 6"" hurricane; that a new ""Category 6"" will be invented specifically for Hurricane Irma","False
					
						
							About this rating","In the wake of the destruction caused by Hurricane Harvey, and in light of the increasing strength of Hurricane Irma, numerous alarmist headlines have suggested that Irma is so strong that it should be identified as a “Category 6” hurricane. Many readers have written in to ask us if Irma is indeed classified as a Category 6. 
Is Irma a Category 6 storm? 
We can say with certainty that Hurricane Irma is not a Category 6 storm and will not become one because that category does not exist. The highest rating on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale is a five, which contains all storms with sustained winds greater than 157 mph.
The idea that Irma is a Category 6 storm seems to have originated with a a blog post that implied that a new category, Category 6, would be created for Irma. While the post does not state this directly, its headline reads “Category 6? If Hurricane Irma Becomes The Strongest Hurricane In History, It Could Wipe Entire Cities Off The Map.” That story, written by end-time enthusiast and Republican candidate for Idaho’s first congressional district Michael Snyder, was first published on his blog “The Economic Collapse” before being aggregated by other clickbait websites.
Are scientists going to create a new Hurricane Wind Scale Category for Irma? 
	
		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
It is true that scientists have brought up the potential need for a new hurricane Category 6. But that discussion began well before the 2017 hurricane season. Snyder juxtaposes quotes about Irma with quotes about the need for a new Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale category in a way that is confusing for readers: 

So how powerful could Irma eventually become? According to Michael Ventrice of the Weather Channel, Irma could easily become a “super typhoon” with “sustained speeds of over 180mph” […]
The scale we have right now really never envisioned storms that powerful.  In fact, some have suggested that we need to add a “category 6” to describe the kind of “super storms” that are now developing in the Atlantic.

A 2015 paper published in Nature Climate Change discussed the prospect of so-called grey swan storms, which the authors defined as “tropical cyclones […] that would not be predicted based on history but may be foreseeable using physical knowledge together with historical data.” 
Using modeling data, the scientists in that study argued that — due to a warming climate — the likelihood of such “grey swan” storms has increased from an essentially negligible level to low but significant level:

Grey swan tropical cyclones striking Tampa, Cairns and Dubai can generate storm surges of about 6 m, 5.7 m and 4 m, respectively, with estimated annual exceedance probabilities [the likelihood of a storm generating surges higher than that] of about 1/10,000. With climate change, these probabilities can increase significantly over the twenty-first century (to 1/3,100–1/1,100 in the middle and 1/2,500–1/700 towards the end of the century for Tampa). Worse grey swan tropical cyclones, inducing surges exceeding 11 m in Tampa and 7 m in Dubai, are also revealed with non-negligible probabilities, especially towards the end of the century.

While Snyder references a blog post that quotes the paper, he does not make it clear that the idea is now two years old — and has nothing to do with Irma. No scientist or meteorologist has suggested that Irma alone is reason to create a new category. 
It is true that Hurricane Irma is a strong and dangerous storm. According to the Washington Post’s Capital Weather Gang, it is “barreling toward the northern Lesser Antilles and Southern Florida [and is] already the strongest hurricane ever recorded outside the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico.” They added that it is “likely to make landfall somewhere in Florida over the weekend.”
However, claims that the size of this specific storm was large enough to spawn discussion of a new hurricane wind category are based on general scientific discussions and not on the strength of Hurricane Irma."

							About this rating","A video showing CNN reporter Drew Griffin and his news crew rushing to the rescue of a man who accidentally drove his truck into a small ravine flooded by Hurricane Harvey went viral on 30 August 2017:


This footage was widely shared along with praise for Griffin and his crew, but almost immediately some viewers accused the news network of staging the rescue.
This particular conspiracy theory, like many conspiracy theories, hinges on nothing more than an incorrect observation: Griffin was allegedly wearing shorts in one portion of the video, but pants in another. InfoWars.com attempted to explain the basis for this accusation:
The video then cuts to the moment when the vehicle becomes marooned in the water. After about 20 seconds, Griffin is seen running towards the vehicle. He is wearing khaki shorts and trainers.
However, in the next clip, where Griffin is seen pulling the man out of the water, he is now wearing dark pants and boots.
	
		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
Although InfoWars.com provides a set of images showing two men in CNN-branded red jackets — one wearing shorts and the other wearing pants — they did not explain how a wardrobe change would prove that this video had been staged, or how changing into pants from shorts would be necessary for the staging of such a video:
<img loading=""lazy"" class=""aligncenter wp-image-102608"" style=""border: 1px solid black;"" src=""https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/09/cnn-didnt-stage-this-video.jpg"" alt="""" width=""600"" height=""173"" data-recalc-dims=""1"" srcset=""https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/09/cnn-didnt-stage-this-video.jpg?resize=1000%2C288&amp;zoom=1 1000w, https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/09/cnn-didnt-stage-this-video.jpg?resize=1000%2C288&amp;zoom=0.5 500w, https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/09/cnn-didnt-stage-this-video.jpg?resize=1000%2C288&amp;zoom=0.25 250w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"" />

This is a moot point, of course, as Griffin did not change his clothes during the course of this footage. The four men that can be seen in the video are reporter Drew Griffin (wearing a red jacket and pants), photographer Scott Pisczek (wearing a black shirt and shorts), producer Brian Rokus (wearing a red jacket and shorts), and Jerry Sumrall (the man who was pulled from the truck, who is not wearing a red jacket). 
Those peddling this claim apparently believe that the man spotted in shorts (around the :31 mark) was reporter Drew Griffin, not his field producer Brian Rokus. But upon reviewing the footage, this is not physically possible. Griffin can be seen running off screen to the left as he chases down the truck down the ravine. When the camera pans over, it shows a second man (Rokus, wearing shorts) who is already standing near the water. Judging by the time that passes between Griffin’s departure from the screen, the direction that he was running, and the audio of his footsteps crunching against the grass, it is not possible for Griffin to be the man in shorts.
What is even less clear is why CNN — a company that has been in the video news business for decades — would put out a hoax video that was so sloppily edited. 
Matt Dornic, CNN’s vice president of communications, sent us a photograph of Griffin and Rokus on location. Both men are pictured wearing red CNN-branded jackets, as is standard for field reporting and producing:
<img loading=""lazy"" class=""aligncenter wp-image-102622"" style=""border: 1px solid black;"" src=""https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/09/cnn-reporters.jpg"" alt="""" width=""600"" height=""338"" data-recalc-dims=""1"" srcset=""https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/09/cnn-reporters.jpg?resize=1600%2C900&amp;zoom=1 1600w, https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/09/cnn-reporters.jpg?resize=1600%2C900&amp;zoom=0.5 800w, https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/09/cnn-reporters.jpg?resize=1600%2C900&amp;zoom=0.25 400w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px"" />

Dornic also called the accusations “total BS” in a tweet:

?Absolutely absurd and total BS. There are two different people wearing CNN rain jackets. Wish I could say I’m surprised but.. https://t.co/O0zyyfT8iC
— Matt Dornic (@mdornic) August 31, 2017

We were also able to view the raw footage of CNN’s rescue, and can confirm that the only things of note edited out of the original footage were a few off-camera curse words and roughly 90 seconds of a blurry street sign. 
This conspiracy theory hinges on the idea that Drew Griffin changed from shorts to pants in the middle of his report. And although we still aren’t sure how this detail would be relevant in the staging of a rescue, this video actually shows two different men, Griffin and his producer Brian Rokus, wearing similar red jackets."

In mid-May 2020, Facebook users began circulating a years-old video in which a man claimed the government was scheming to forcibly round up unvaccinated people. The video circulated widely without any indication as to when it was filmed and with the words “Heads up Oklahoma” edited in, leading some to think it pertained to the ongoing COVID-19 coronavirus disease pandemic, specifically in the state of Oklahoma.
The video, which has been on YouTube since 2009, featured Greg Evensen, a blogger who described himself as a former Kansas State Trooper. In the video, Evensen discussed a government “edict of mandated vaccinations”:



 

Evensen said in the video that he had been “told by state troopers across the country that there are plans ready to be implemented that include roadblocks and chokepoints,” and that there was a plan to fit members of the public with microchips containing “all kinds of information,” including whether they had been vaccinated. Anyone who refused to be vaccinated, Evensen said, would be placed in buses and shipped off to detention.
Evensen’s comments appeared to be a variation on a cross between two long-standing conspiracy theories. One theory centers on the mass detention of Americans — in most iterations the detention is to take place in camps created by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). And the other theory centers on activists who believe vaccines are harmful, and that a nefarious conspiracy exists to force them on the public. His remarks were made during the H1N1 swine flu pandemic of 2009.
This isn’t the first time a large-scale emergency prompted a variation of the claim that FEMA would be forcing people to receive vaccines. During Hurricane Harvey in 2017, a false claim circulated that the agency was denying those impacted by the storm any aid unless they had been vaccinated.
Because the video was made in 2009 and had nothing to do with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic (for which there was no vaccine, anyway, as of this writing), and because the statements made in the video alluded to unfounded conspiracies that have not come to pass, we rate this claim “False.”"

This is not a genuine photograph of President Trump. 
The original photograph, which showed a man named Brandon Smith rescuing his two cats from floodwaters in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, in June 2008, was taken by photographer Harry Baumert of the Des Moines Register. Although the original article containing the image is no longer online, the Iowa newspaper reprinted the photograph in a 2009 article that provided an update on Smith and his cats:
Brandon Smith wading through water in Cedar Rapids with his cats clutched to his chest embodied the ultimate test of mettle that the historic disaster foisted upon Iowa. Yet the cats with clinging paws reflected perhaps the entirety of 2008 a year in which we often felt as if we needed to hold on as tight as we could. The good news is, like Smith and his cats, we endured and in some cases thrived. Smith, fiancee Sarah Neumann and their beloved pets are dry and living in a farmhouse near De Witt. The couple, who already have a toddler, two dogs and a third cat, are adding to their brood, expecting their second child. 
To create the doctored photograph, someone placed Trump’s headonto Smith’s shoulders. Here’s a side-by-side comparison of the fake image (left) and the original photograph (right):

Photographer David Greedy also captured several photographs of Smith rescuing his cats from the flood waters in June 2008. One of them, available via Getty Images, was accompanied by the following caption:

Much of the city has been evacuated as the Cedar River continues to rise to record levels. More rains are predicted over the next few days. (Photo by David Greedy/Getty Images)
This isn’t the first fake rescue photograph of President Trump. He was also digitally manipulated into an image of a rescue boat in choppy waters. In the days following Hurricane Harvey, many other fake or miscaptioned photographs also appeared online."

							About this rating","On 29 August 2017, a satirical Facebook page called “The Cajun Navy” (not to be confused with the actual Cajun Navy, a nonprofit organization whose members have been conducting rescues of Harvey victims on the ground) posted a now-viral meme that appeared to exploit Internet-driven outrage over the misleading rumor that “Prosperity Gospel” preacher Joel Osteen had closed his 16,000-capacity megachurch in Houston to refugees from floodwaters caused by Tropical Storm Harvey, which made landfall in southeast Texas in late August 2017.
The meme stated that only 60 of Houston’s 1,566 churches had opened their doors to flood victims. It was shared thousands of times although it provided no citation for the figures:

There are 1566 churches in Houston. 
They are all tax exempt. 
They are tax exempt so they can help the needy.

Only 60 (4%) out of 1566 have opened their doors to help the flood victims and the needy during hurricane Harvey. Let that sink in for a moment.
“The Cajun Navy” page has shared several other posts mocking Osteen and his church for their response to Hurricane Harvey. 
Despite the fact none of the figures in the meme are attributed, it was picked up by a Huffington Post community blogger who used it as leverage in arguing that churches should be taxed because they do an inadequate job of providing charity.
	
		
			
				
			
			
		
	
		
		
However, according to the Internal Revenue Service, religious organizations are tax exempt to promote religious freedom, not because they provide charity:
Congress has enacted special tax laws that apply to churches, religious organizations and ministers in recognition of their unique status in American society and of their rights guaranteed by the First Amendment of the Constitution of the United States. Churches and religious organizations are generally exempt from income tax and receive other favorable treatment under the tax law; however, certain income of a church or religious organization may be subject to tax, such as income from an unrelated business.
The meme was shared on 29 August 2017, just a few days after Hurricane Harvey made landfall in Texas — and it seems highly unlikely someone conducted a survey of all of the churches in Houston during this time. Although we don’t know the exact percentage of churches that opened their doors (or the number that couldn’t, due to flood damage), we have come across multiple reports of churches coming to the aid of those in need in the wake of Hurricane Harvey:
The firefighters put a call out for help, asking if anyone could take the evacuees in. One local youth pastor answered the call. The rescue teams picked up Pastor David McDougle, 26, and his wife from their flooded home so they could open the First Baptist Church North Houston as a makeshift shelter for those stranded.
McDougle said he got a call Sunday evening asking if he would let evacuees sleep at the church, so he and his wife took all the food and water they had gotten and brought it to the church.
Though they now have a roof over their heads, the church is not a designated shelter and has no food or water for the evacuees. The church reached capacity with nearly 300 people laying on the floor of the gym, and the food supply ran out around 5 a.m. People are nervous to drink tap water. The restrooms at the church will not flush, creating a mess of the place.

Houston’s First Baptist Church, led by Pastor Greg Matte, is also participating in relief efforts, providing food and shelter to those in need.

Pastor Kirbyjon Caldwell, a former faith adviser to George W. Bush and pastor of Windsor Village United Methodist Church, announced that as of Monday, his church would house those affected by another round of evacuations. 
Max Moll, a spokesman for Houston Controller Chris Brown, told us that churches have in fact been helping in various capacities, depending on their ability and circumstance in relation to flood damage. Some have been volunteering while others have been donating clothing and other supplies. Others have opened their doors to shelter stranded residents. Moll told us:
It’s up to each individual entity to decide what they can and can’t do. Some [of the churches] are without power, or are flooded, or the roads around them are impassable. There are a lot of ways to respond and a lot of churches have responded in strong ways.
In general terms, the city has three official shelter locations where thousands are being housed — the George R. Brown Convention Center, the Toyota Center and NRG Center. Osteen told “CBS This Morning” that his church has been coordinating its relief efforts with the city and opened the church for shelter when the city’s overflowed:
We worked with the city constantly. The city set up a shelter about four miles from here that can house 10,000 people, showers, dormitories, kitchens, security, all that. They didn’t need us as a shelter at that point. They wanted us to be a distribution center. … When they filled up, they said “we need shelter,” we started our shelter."
